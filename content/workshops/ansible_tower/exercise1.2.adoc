= Exercise 1.2 - Running Your Playbook


== Section 1: Running the playbook


We are now going to run your brand-new playbook, on your two web nodes.  To do this,
 you are going to use the `ansible-playbook` command.

=== Step 1: Run your playbook

From your playbook directory ( `~/apache_basic` ), run your playbook.

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i ../hosts install_apache.yml --private-key=~/.ssh/{{< span2 "prefix" "example" "-tower" >}}
----


However, before you run that command, lets take a few moments to understand the options.

- *--private-key* This option asks for the private ssh key to connect to the remote machine.
- *-i* This option allows you to specify the inventory file you wish to use.
- *-v* Altough not used here, this increases verbosity.  Try running your playbook a second time using `-v` or `-vv` to increase the verbosity (debugging information).


[NOTE]
- *--syntax-check* If you run into any issues with your playbook running properly (from the copy/pasting that we told you not to do), you could use this option to help find those issues like so...

[source,bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i ../hosts install_apache.yml --syntax-check --private-key=~/.ssh/{{< span2 "prefix" "example" "-tower" >}}
----


---
Now, run your playbook as specified in *Step 1*

In standard output, you should see something that looks very similar to the following:

image::stdout_1.png[caption="Figure 1: ", title="apache_basic playbook stdout",328]

Notice that the play and each task is named, so that you can understand the action being performed and the node it is being performed upon.
You also may notice a task in there that you didn't write;  <cough> `setup` <cough>.  This is because the `setup` module
runs by default.  To turn if off, you can specify link:{gather_facts_url}[gather_facts: false] in your play definition like this:


[source,bash]
----
---
- hosts: web
  name: Install the apache web service
  become: yes
  gather_facts: false
----



=== Step 2: Remove Apache

Now, let's experiment a little.
We would like you to reverse what you've done (i.e. stop and uninstall apache on your web nodes).
So, edit your playbook and then when you're finished, rerun it - as described in *Step 1*.
For this exercise we aren't going to show you line by line, but we will give you a few hints.

[NOTE]

- If your first task in the playbook was to install httpd and the second task was to start the service, which order do you think
those tasks should be in now?
- If `started` makes sure a service is started, then what option ensures it is stopped?
- If `present` makes sure a package is installed, then what option ensures it is removed?  Er... starts with an *ab*, ends with a *sent*
