= Exercise 2.1 - Configuring Ansible Tower




In this exercise, we are going to configure Tower so that we can run a playbook.
[NOTE]


== Configuring Ansible Tower

There are a number of contructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc.
However, we are only going to focus on a few of the key contructs that are required for this workshop today.


* Credentials
* Projects
* Inventory
* Job Template




== Logging into Tower and Installing the License Key


=== Step 1:

To log in, use the username `admin` and and the password `ansibleWS`.



image::ansible-lab-figure01-logon-screen.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title="Ansible Tower Login Screen"]


As soon as you login, you will prompted to request a license or browse for an existing license file

:cred_url: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#credential-types



=== Step 2:

At the commandline in your Tower instance download the encrypted license file via the curl command.

[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/ansible-tower-workshop-license/license
----

Then Decrypt the license file via Ansible Vault.
**The instructor should provide the password**

[source,bash]
----
ansible-vault decrypt license --ask-vault-pass

...

Vault password:
----

Now use curl to POST the license to the Tower API endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
curl -k https://localhost/api/v1/config/ \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST \
     --data @license \
     --user admin:ansibleWS

----


// === Step 3:

// Back in the Tower UI, choose BROWSE image:at_browse.png[LicB,35,25] and upload your
// recently downloaded license file into Tower.

// === Step 4:

// Select "_I agree to the End User License Agreement_"

// === Step 5:

// Click on SUBMIT image:at_submit.png[Sub,35,25]




== Creating a Credential

Credentials are utilized by Tower for authentication when launching jobs against machines,
synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

There are many link:{cred_url}[types of credentials] including machine, network, and various cloud providers.  In this
workshop, we are using a *machine* credential.


=== Step 1:

Select the gear icon     image:at_gear.png[Gear,20,20]

=== Step 2:

Select CREDENTIALS

=== Step 3:

Click on ADD     image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 4:

Complete the form using the following entries, by printing out your private SSH key to place into Tower.  When you paste the key in, in the `PRIVATE KEY` field, make sure to include the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` lines.

----
cat ~/.ssh/{{< span2 "prefix" "example" "-tower" >}}

=== Step 5:

Select SAVE     image:at_save.png[Save,35,25] +



== Creating a Project

A Project is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks, represented in Tower.
You can manage playbooks and playbook directories by either placing them manually
under the Project Base Path on your Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into
a source code management (SCM) system supported by Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

=== Step 1:

Click on PROJECTS

=== Step 2:

Select ADD     image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3:

Complete the form using the following entries:

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Project
|DESCRIPTION|workshop playbooks
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|SCM TYPE|Git
|SCM URL| https://github.com/ansible/lightbulb
|SCM BRANCH| 
|SCM UPDATE OPTIONS
a|

- [*] Clean
- [*] Delete on Update
- [*] Update on Launch

image::at_project_detail.png[Cred_Detail, 900,caption="Figure 6: ",title="Defining a Project"]



=== Step 4:

Select SAVE     image:at_save.png[Save,35,25]




== Creating a Inventory

An inventory is a collection of hosts against which jobs may be launched.
Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the actual hosts.
Groups may be sourced manually, by entering host names into Tower, or from one
of Ansible Tower’s supported cloud providers.

An Inventory can also be imported into Tower using the `tower-manage` command
and this is how we are going to add an inventory for this workshop.


=== Step 1:

Click on INVENTORIES

=== Step 2:

Select ADD     image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3:

Complete the form using the following entries

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Inventory
|DESCRIPTION|workshop hosts
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|===



image::at_inv_create.png[Cred_Detail,900,caption="Figure 7: ",title="Create an Inventory"]



=== Step 4:

Select SAVE     image:at_save.png[Save,35,25]

=== Step 5:

Using ssh, login to your control node, if by any chance you closed the wetty browser window.  Remember to replace *workshopname* with your workshop name, and *#* with your student number.


[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn "https://" "tower" ":8888/wetty/ssh/ec2-user" >}}
----




=== Step 6:

Use the `tower-manage` command to import an existing inventory.  (_Be sure to replace <username> with your actual username_)
----
sudo tower-manage inventory_import --source=/home/ec2-user/hosts --inventory-name="Ansible Workshop Inventory"
----

You should see output similar to the following:



image::at_tm_stdout.png[Cred_Detail,900,caption="Figure 8: ",title="Importing an inventory with tower-manage"]




Feel free to browse your inventory in Tower.  You should now notice that the inventory has been populated with Groups and that
each of those groups contain hosts.

=== End Result

At this point, we are doing with our basic configuration of Ansible Tower.  In exercise 2.2, we will be soley focused on creating and running a job template so you can see Tower in action.
