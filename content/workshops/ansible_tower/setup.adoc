= Workshop Lab Setup



[IMPORTANT]
Today's workshop infrastructure is being run in Amazon EC2. +
Each student will have two instances to use. +
Each of you should have received an email.  It has the following information on it. +

If you didn't get one of these emails, let us know so we can give you the information about your lab environment.






== Workshop Infrastructure

Each student's personal EC2 lab is equipped with the following:

* (1) Control node (to run ansible plays and install Ansible Tower).
* (1) Endpoint nodes (to execute ansible playbooks upon).
** _All three of the afore mentioned nodes are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3_
* Ansible Core 2.2
* Ansible Tower 3.0.3

.Setup Your Environment

Before we can begin doing super-cool automations and such, we've got to get a few basics out of the way.
Namely... ssh access to your EC2 nodes.


== Testing your environment

Loginto your instances via the following links:


{tower_url}

{ssh_url}


[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your ec2 instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!



== End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into each of your 2 nodes.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
