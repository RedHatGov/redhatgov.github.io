= Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands


== Section 1: Ad-hoc commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get
a feel for how Ansible works.  Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks
on remote nodes without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you
simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.



=== Step 0:

Define your inventory.  Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote machines on which you wish to run
commands or your playbook(s).  Use `vi` or `vim` to create a file called `hosts`.  Then, add the appropriate definitions for the node that will function as a web node.

[NOTE]
The *workshopname*, in the example below, will be provided to you by your instructor.  The *#* should be replaced by your student number.

For example, a recent workshop's first student used:
*{{< urifqdn "" "tower" "" >}}*
====

.hosts (example)
[source,bash]
----
[web]
{{< urifqdn "" "node" "" >}}
----

=== Step 1:

Let's start with something really basic - pinging a host.  The `ping` module makes sure our web hosts are responsive.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m ping
----

=== Step 2:

Now let's see how we can run a good ol' fashioned Linux command and format the output using the `command` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m command -a "uptime" -o
----

=== Step 3:

Take a look at your web node's configuration.  The `setup` module displays ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m setup
----

=== Step 4:

Now, let's install Maven & Git using the `package` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m package -a "name=rh-maven35 state=present" -b
ansible web -m package -a "name=git state=present" -b
----

=== Step 5:

It is even possible to install groups of packages (aka yum groupinstall); such as Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP).

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m package -a "name=@jboss-eap7 state=present" -b
----

=== Step 6:

OK, JBoss EAP is installed now so let's start it up using the `service` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=eap7-standalone state=started" -b
----

=== Step 7:

Next, let's deploy an application.

For simplicity sake, we will use an existing quickstart. To get started, we will checkout some code ...

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m git -a "repo=https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts.git dest=/tmp/checkout"
----

and deploy the code via Maven provided by Red Hat Software Collections.
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m shell -a "scl enable rh-maven35 'mvn clean install wildfly:deploy -Dmaven.test.skip=true' chdir=/tmp/checkout/helloworld" -b
----

Demo site (unit test):
[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m uri -a "url=http://localhost:8080/helloworld/ return_content=yes"
----

Demo site (open this in your web browser):
[source,bash]
----
http://{{< urifqdn "" "node" "" >}}:8080/helloworld/
----

=== Step 8:

Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the Red Hat JBoss EAP service.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=eap7-standalone state=stopped" -b
----

=== Step 9:

Next, remove some packages.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m package -a "name=@jboss-eap7 state=absent" -b
ansible web -m package -a "name=eap7-* state=absent" -b
ansible web -m package -a "name=rh-maven35 state=absent" -b
ansible web -m package -a "name=git state=absent" -b
----


====
[NOTE]
Like many Linux commands, `ansible` allows for long-form options as well as short-form.  For example:

----
ansible web --module-name ping
----
is the same as running
----
ansible web -m ping
----
We are going to be using the short-form options throughout this workshop
