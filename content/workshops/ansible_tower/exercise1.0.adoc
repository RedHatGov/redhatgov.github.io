= Exercise 1.0 - Running Ad-hoc commands


== Section 1: Ad-hoc commands

For our first exercise, we are going to run some ad-hoc commands to help you get
a feel for how Ansible works.  Ansible Ad-Hoc commands enable you to perform tasks
on remote nodes without having to write a playbook.  They are very useful when you
simply need to do one or two things quickly and often, to many remote nodes.



=== Step 0:

Define your inventory.  Inventories are crucial to Ansible as they define remote machines on which you wish to run
commands or your playbook(s).  Use `vi` or `vim` to create a file called `hosts`.  Then, add the appropriate definitions for the node that will function as a web node.

.hosts (example)
[source,bash]
----
[web]
node-2 ansible_host=workshop.node.2.redhatgov.io
----

=== Step 1:

Let's start with something really basic - pinging a host.  The `ping` module makes sure our web hosts are responsive.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m ping
----

=== Step 2:

Now let's see how we can run a good ol' fashioned Linux command and format the output using the `command` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m command -a "uptime" -o
----

=== Step 3:

Take a look at your web node's configuration.  The `setup` module displays ansible facts (and a lot of them) about an endpoint.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m setup
----

=== Step 4:

Now, let's install Apache using the `yum` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=present" -b
----

=== Step 5:

OK, Apache is installed now so let's start it up using the `service` module.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b
----

=== Step 6:

Finally, let's clean up after ourselves.  First, stop the httpd service.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped" -b
----

=== Step 7:

Next, remove the Apache package.

[source,bash]
----
ansible web -m yum -a "name=httpd state=absent" -b
----




====
[NOTE]
Like many Linux commands, `ansible` allows for long-form options as well as short-form.  For example:

----
ansible web --module-name ping
----
is the same as running
----
ansible web -m ping
----
We are going to be using the short-form options throughout this workshop
