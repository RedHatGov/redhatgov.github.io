Select SAVE image:at_save.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 8:

== Running a Job Template

Now that you've sucessfully creating your Job Template, you are ready to launch it.
Once you do, you will be redirected to a job screen which is refreshing in realtime
showing you the status of the job.


=== Step 1:

Select JOB TEMPLATES
[NOTE]
Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from
the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

=== Step 2:

Click on the rocketship icon image:at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *Apache Basic Job Template*

=== Step 3:

When prompted, enter your desired test message

=== Step 4:

Select LAUNCH image:at_survey_launch.png[SurveyL,35,25]

=== Step 5:

Sit back, watch the magic happen

One of the first things you will notice is the summary section.  This gives you details about
your job such as who launched it, what playbook it's running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete.

Scrolling down, you will be able to see details on the play and each task in the playbook.

To the right, you can view standard output; the same way you could if you were running Ansible Core
from the command line.

=== Step 6:

Once your job is sucessful, navigate to your new website

[source,bash]

If all went well, you should see something like this, but with your own custom message of course.
