= Exercise 3.0 - Using Ansible to Implement Security

== Exercise Description
In this exercise, we are going to use Red Hat Ansible Tower to run *DISA STIG and NIST 800-53 evaluations* of our environment.  Note that the NIST 800-53 role also includes the execution of DISA STIG evaluation against targeted hosts.

DISA STIG controls

NIST 800-53 controls
https://galaxy.ansible.com/rhtps/800-53/


=== Step 1: Download role to Ansible roles directory

In your wetty window (if you closed it, see the link:/workshops/ansible_tower/setup/[SETUP] step, in your workbook), type the following:

[source,bash]
----
sudo ansible-galaxy install rhtps.800-53 -p /etc/ansible/roles
----

The image below illustrates that the role has been downloaded to your system-wide Ansible roles directory, `/etc/ansible/roles`:

[source,bash]
----
- downloading role '800-53', owned by rhtps
- downloading role from https://github.com/rhtps/ansible-role-800-53/archive/v1.1.1.tar.gz
- extracting rhtps.800-53 to /etc/ansible/roles/rhtps.800-53
- rhtps.800-53 (v1.1.1) was installed successfully

=== Step 9: Save the template and run it

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save], to store your new template, and we are ready to run it.

Click  the rocketship icon image:at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] next to the `NIST 800-53 and DISA STIG Job Template` entry, to launch the job.

View what the job looks like as it is executing, as well as what the SCAP results look like, when uploaded to your second node, in the panel, below.

=== Step 10: Observe the scanning process and view reports

You can watch the scan run against your managed node.  Note that each compliance check is named and detailed.

Once the check is complete, you can open a new tab in your web browser, and navigate to the following URL, where `workshopname` is the workshop prefix, and `#` is the number that your instructor gave you:

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn "http://" "node" "/scap" >}}
----

Click the link called `scan-xccdf-report-...` to review the SCAP report that was generated.  Note the failures in the report; look at the machines, if you want, via your Wetty ssh session, to analyze what the problems might be.
