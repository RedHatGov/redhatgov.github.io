== Overview

The Ansible Tower Workshop is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Ansible, whether you have used it or not. We are going to start with a short overview and then we’ll get into the lab as soon as possible. That is where we will spend most of our time.

Your Responsibilities
Have a Discussion. This will be boring if it’s just us, up here talking for over 4 hours.

Participate. We are going to cut you loose with Ansible, in just a little while. Have questions. Have opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy. See? Not only can we dig into Ansible but you can make a new friend!
