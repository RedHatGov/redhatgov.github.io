= Exercise 2.2 - Creating and Running a Job Template

== Exercise Description
This exercise will walk you through the steps required to create a job template and run it.

A job template is a definition and set of parameters for running an Ansible job. In other words, a template combines an Ansible project playbook and the settings required to launch it, into one package.

Templates save setup time, for jobs that are launched repetitively. Once the template is set, it can be edited for future jobs, with different settings.

Templates also drive uniformity, by running templates exactly the same way every time. And, because we're using templates, production responsibilities can be delegated to less experienced production personnel.

== Creating a Job Template


=== Step 1: Navigate to the Templates tab

Select TEMPLATES

=== Step 2: Create a new template

Click ADD image:at_add.png[Add,35,25], and select JOB TEMPLATE

Complete the template form, by entering the following values:

|===

=== Step 4: Save

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save] and then select ADD SURVEY image:at_addsurvey.png[Add]

=== Step 5: Complete survey

Job surveys provide extra playbook variables and present them in a user-friendly way. They also enable validation of the input you provide.

Complete the survey form with following values.

|===
|PROMPT|Please enter a test message for your new website
|DESCRIPTION|Website test message prompt
|ANSWER VARIABLE NAME|apache_test_message
|ANSWER TYPE|Text
|MINIMUM/MAXIMUM LENGTH| Use the defaults
|DEFAULT ANSWER| Be creative, keep it clean, we're all professionals here
|===

=== Step 6: Add the survey input

Select ADD image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 7: Save

Select SAVE image:at_save.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 8: Save at the main page

Back on the main Job Template page, select SAVE image:at_save.png[Add,35,25] again.




== Section 2: Running a job template

Now that you've sucessfully creating your Job Template, you are ready to launch it.
You will be redirected to a job screen, which refreshes in realtime
and displays the status of the job.


=== Step 1: Select the Template tab

Select TEMPLATES
[NOTE]
Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

=== Step 2: Access Apache Basic Job Template

Click on the rocketship icon image:at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *Apache Basic Job Template*

=== Step 3: Enter test message

When prompted, enter your desired test message

=== Step 4:

Select LAUNCH image:at_survey_launch.png[SurveyL,35,25]

=== Step 5: Launch the job

Sit back, watch the magic happen

One of the first things you will notice is the summary section.  This gives you details about
your job such as who launched it, what playbook it's running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete.

Scroll down and view details on the play and each task in the playbook.

To the right, you can view standard output; the same way you could if you were running Ansible Core from the command line.

=== Step 6: View the new website

Once your job is sucessful, navigate to your new website, where *workshopname* is the name of your workshop, and *#* is your student number:

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn_azure "http://" "node" "" >}}
----


If all went well, you should see something like this, but with your own custom message:
