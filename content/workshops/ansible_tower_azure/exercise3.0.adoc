= Exercise 3.0 - Using Ansible to Implement Security
== Exercise Description

In this exercise, we are going to use Ansible Tower to run DISA STIG and NIST 800-53 evaluations of our environment.  Note that the NIST 800-53 role also includes the execution of DISA STIG evaluation against targeted hosts.

DISA STIG controls
https://galaxy.ansible.com/MindPointGroup/RHEL7-STIG/

NIST 800-53 controls
https://galaxy.ansible.com/rhtps/800-53/

== Adding the DISA STIG and NIST 800-53 role to your Tower node

=== Step 1: Download role to Ansible roles directory

In your wetty window (if you closed it, see the link:/workshops/ansible_tower/setup/[SETUP] step, in your workbook), type the following:

[source,bash]
----
sudo ansible-galaxy install rhtps.800-53 -p /etc/ansible/roles
----

You will then see the following, showing that the role has been downloaded to your system-wide Ansible roles directory, `/etc/ansible/roles`:

[source,bash]
----
- downloading role '800-53', owned by rhtps
- downloading role from https://github.com/rhtps/ansible-role-800-53/archive/v1.1.1.tar.gz
- extracting rhtps.800-53 to /etc/ansible/roles/rhtps.800-53
- rhtps.800-53 (v1.1.1) was installed successfully

=== Step 9: Save the template and run it

Click SAVE image:at_save.png[Save], to store your new template, and we are ready to run it.

Click on the rocketship icon image:at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] next to the `NIST 800-53 and DISA STIG Job Template` entry, to launch the job.

You can see what the job looks like, as it is executing, and what the SCAP results look like, when uploaded to your second node, in the panel, below.

=== Step 10: Observe the scanning process and view reports

You can watch the scan run against your managed node.  Note that each compliance check is named and detailed.

Once the check is complete, you can open a new tab in your web browser, and navigate to the following URL, where `workshopname` is the workshop prefix, and `#` is the number that your instructor gave you:

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn_azure "http://" "node" "/scap" >}}
----

Click on the link called `scan-xccdf-report-...` to refiew the SCAP report that was generated.  Note the failures in the report; look at the machines, if you want, via your Wetty ssh session, to see what the problems might be.
