= Exercise 1.9 - Image Streams & Secrets

image::secrets.png[]

== Image Stream

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-streams[Image
streams] can be used to automatically perform an action when new images are
created. Builds and deployments can watch an image stream to receive
notifications when new images are added and react by performing a build or
deployment, respectively.

For example, if a deployment is using a certain image and a new version of that
image is created, a deployment could be automatically performed.

== Secrets

A
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/dev_guide/secrets.html#secrets-image-pull-secrets[Secret]
is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password,
a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a Pod
specification or in an image; putting it in a Secret object allows for more
control over how it is used, and reduces the risk of accidental exposure. Users
can create secrets, and the system also creates some secrets.

Key properties include:

- Secret data can be referenced independently from its definition.
- Secret data volumes are backed by temporary file-storage facilities (`tmpfs`)
and never come to rest on a node.
- Secret data can be shared within a namespace.

== Image Streams & Secrets

=== Step 1:

*Check your user*

.see what user you are loged in as
[source]
----
oc whoami
----

.login as system:admin
[source]
----
oc login -u system:admin
----

=== Step 2:

*Create the default image streams*

Now we are going to create a JBoss
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html[image
stream]. Image streams present a single virtual view of related images.

.create the image stream
[source]
----
cd jboss-openshift-templates

oc create -n openshift -f jboss-image-streams.json
----

.switch to developer
[source]
----
oc login -u developer
----

Now create a new project called `SSO`.

.SSO Project
[source]
----
oc new-project sso --description="Red Hat SSO" --display-name="SSO Keycloak"
----

Click on the `SSO Keycloak` project you just created.

.Click SSO Keycloak Project

=== Step 3:

*Create Red Hat SSO application*

The Red Hat SSO container needs secrets from the Java Key Store (jks for
short). Instead of hard coding these into the SSO image itself, OpenShift
utilizes
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/dev_guide/secrets.html#secrets-image-pull-secrets[`Secrets`]
to hold the sensitive information.

To get a feeling of what a secrets file looks like `cat` out the following file.

[source]
----
cat secrets/sso-app-secret.json
----

This is a excerpt of the `Secret` file.

.sso-app-secret.json
[source]
----
"kind": "Secret", <1>
"apiVersion": "v1",
"metadata": {
    "annotations": {
        "description": "Default secret file with name 'jboss' and password 'mykeystorepass'"
      },
        "name": "sso-app-secret" <2>
      },
        "data": {
                "keystore.jks": "/u3+7QAAAAIAAAABAAAAAQAF.....<snip> <3>
----


<1> Type of Object

<2> Name of the `Secret`

<3> The actual key & value of the secret, base64 encoded.

The Secret object type provides a mechanism to hold sensitive information such
as passwords. Secrets decouple sensitive content from the pods. You can mount
secrets into containers using a volume plug-in or the system can use secrets to
perform actions on behalf of a pod.

.create `secrets` for `SSO`
[source]
----
oc create -n sso -f secrets/sso-app-secret.json
----

Now lets launch the app

.launch `SSO`
[source]
----
oc process -f sso/sso71-https.json -p HTTPS_NAME=jboss HTTPS_PASSWORD=mykeystorepass | oc create -n sso -f -
----

You will see two pods with different
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.4/architecture/core_concepts/routes.html[routes]
being built, the first is for a plain `http` route to the app, the second is
via a `https` route. Click the top url (example for student 0:
`https://secure-sso-sso.apps.ose.0.redhatgov.io`).

.SSO Keycloak Project
image::sso-overview.png[]

*Add `auth` to the end of the url*

image::sso-auth.png[]

Now click Administration Console

image::sso-admin-console.png[]

The default password is admin / admin

.login to SSO
[source]
----
username:  admin

password:  admin
----

.Red Hat SSO Login
image::sso-main-login.png[]

This is Red Hat's SSO server. Red Hat Single Sign-On (RH-SSO) is based on the
Keycloak project and enables you to secure your web applications by providing
Web single sign-on (SSO) capabilities based on popular standards such as SAML
2.0, OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0.

The RH-SSO server can act as a SAML or OpenID Connect-based Identity Provider,
mediating with your enterprise user directory or 3rd-party SSO provider for
identity information and your applications via standards-based tokens. This is
like having your own login with your Gmail or Facebook account you see all over
the web. Now you can control your own identity provider instead of relying on
third parties for that.

Features:

- *Authentication Server:* Acts as a standalone SAML or OpenID Connect-based
Identity Provider.
- *User Federation:* Certified with LDAP servers and Microsoft Active Directory
as sources for user information.
- *Identity Brokering:* Integrates with 3rd-party Identity Providers including
leading social networks as identity source.
- *REST APIs and Administration GUI:* Specify user federation, role mapping,
and client applications with easy-to-use Administration GUI and REST APIs.

.Red Hat SSO Overview
image::sso-main.png[]

We went over a lot in this one, but if you made it this far you successfully

- Deployed a OpenShift `imagestream`
- Learned about OpenShift `Secrets`
- Deployed a `SSL` secured & containerized application
- Got a overview of `Red Hat SSO`
