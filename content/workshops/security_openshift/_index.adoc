== Today's Agenda

== Before We Get Started

=== Overview

Today is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Containers, whether you have
used them or not. We are going to start with a short overview (yes, slideware)
and then we'll get into the lab as soon as possible. That is where we will
spend most of our time.

=== Your Responsibilities

* Have a discussion. This will be boring if it's just us up here talking for
over 4 hours.
* Participate. We are going to cut you loose with Containers here in just a
little while. Have questions. Have opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing
buddy. See? Not only can we dig into Containers but you can make a new friend!
