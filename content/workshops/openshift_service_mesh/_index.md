# OpenShift Service Mesh

## Description 

As modern applications move toward microservices based architectures the importance of a platform to back both development and operational work grows. Development teams struggle with building, debugging, and connecting services properly. And application operations teams face increasing challenges with hybrid deployments, scaling bottlenecks, recovering from failure, and gathering metrics. Red Hatâ€™s OpenShift Service Mesh lets you connect, secure, control, and observe your microservice based applications.


## Who should attend

The workshop is ideal for developers, architects, and technical leads interested in learning more about the latest technologies for microservices based applications. You should be familiar with the fundamentals of containers and Kubernetes.


## What you will learn

In this full day, hands-on workshop you'll learn about to operate and manage a service mesh for a microservices application using Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh. You will get hands-on experience with:
- Installing a service mesh
- Building containers for your microservices
- Leveraging a service mesh to improve operational observability
- Leveraging a service mesh to address microservice challenges
- Leveraging a service mesh to implement microservice security
