# Introduction

Welcome to the JBoss Windup workshop!  This particular workshop will learn how to use various tools and techniques to assess your migration to JBoss EAP 7, customize specific rules to allow for a more complete migration, and the various ways you can initiate a automated migration using IDEs or browser-based methods.

If you are on-site with us, the instructor will walk you through and kick off each lab.  Otherwise, if you're running this on your own, just go through the list of labs below in order (as some build off of each other).
