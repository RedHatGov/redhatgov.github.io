# That's it!
Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to migrate to a Red Hat Jboss EAP environment.  And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how JBoss EAP can benefit your existing application ecosystem and move you in the direction of cloud-based architecture and modernization.  Please feel free to continue to "kick the tires" in the demo environment we've setup and explore both the web console and an Eclipsed-based IDE like JBoss Developer Studio.

# Get even deeper
While you're here, we can help you install JBoss EAP on your laptop.  It requires only one download and the install process is reallly easy.  You can find the [install and getting started guides here][4].

Here are some good resources to continue learning Red Hat JBoss EAP:
