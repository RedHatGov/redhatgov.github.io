# Create a Java-Based Rule Addon Goals

In the XXX lab, you created a Windup report from a sample JEE application called `jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear`. This sample JEE application includes a Java class file called `com.acme.anvil.service.jms.LogEventSubscriber`. This class is a JEE Message Driven Bean component. During this lab, you create a custom Java-based Windup rule that is triggered when encountering this class file.  This lab guides you through the process of building a custom Java-based Windup rule, deploying the new rule, running Windup with the new rule, and viewing the results in a refreshed Windup report.

* Learn how to create a Windup addon
* Generate a Java-based custom Windup rule
* Install and test the custom Windup rule

## Prerequisites

* Completion of the XXX lab
* Familiarization with the following documentation and examples:
    * `OCPsoft Rewrite` - Windup rules are based on the OCPsoft Rewrite project. For more information about this project, see [here][1].
    * `Windup API JavaDoc` - The JavaDoc for the Windup API is located [here][2].
    * `Example Java-based Windup rules` - Working examples of Java-based rules can be found in the [here][3] GitHub repository.

## Step 1.  Analyze Existing Windup Report

Start by viewing the results of executing Windup in the XXX lab.

1. Open a browser and navigate to the `index.html` file of the generated Windup Report.

2. Search for the following class in `index.html`:
~~~~
com.acme.anvil.service.jms.LogEventSubscriber
~~~~

3. Click its link.

4. Observe the following:

* There are no classifications or hints for the Windup report section that are specific to this class.
* The use of proprietary Weblogic classes.

## Step 2. Create a Maven Project

In this section you create a custom Java rule that gets triggered on this Java class and provides a migration team with a story point.

1. Create a simple maven project using the following `pom.xml`:

~~~~
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>com.sample</groupId>
  <artifactId>example-java-rule</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</project>
~~~~

## Step 3. Create the RuleProvider

1. Within the new com.example:example-java-rule:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT Maven project, create a Java package:
    1. Name the package com.example

2. To be a CDI-compliant addon that can be loaded by Furnace, you must include a beans.xml file:
    1. Navigate to example-java-rule -> src/main/resources.
    2. Add a folder with the name META-INF
    3. Change to the META-INF folder and create an empty file named beans.xml.


  <img src="../images/lab5-3.png" width="452" />


3. Create a new Java class within the `com.example package` and name it `MyCustomRuleProvider`.

4. Navigate to `MyCustomRuleProvider.java` and add the content to your custom rule.  The project should now appear as follows:

  <img src="../images/lab5-4.png" width="452" />


## Step 4. Understand MyCustomRuleProvider

The rule `com.example.MyCustomRuleProvider` is a high-level rule that uses high-level conditions (JavaClass) and operations (Classification).

The class defines five story points regarding the inheritance of `weblogic.ejb.GenericMessageDrivenBean`.

The class also defines two story points that suggest the removal of proprietary import statements.

## Step 5. Analyze MyCustomRuleProvider

~~~~
public class MyCustomRuleProvider extends WindupRuleProvider {                                               1

public Configuration getConfiguration(GraphContext arg0) {                                                   2

return ConfigurationBuilder.begin()                                                                          3
  .addRule()
  .when(                                                                                                     4
    JavaClass.references("weblogic.ejb.GenericMessageDrivenBean")
             .at(TypeReferenceLocation.INHERITANCE)
  )
  .perform(                                                                                                  5

       Hint.withText("WebLogic Server Generic Bean Template Inheritance")
       .with(Link.to("Message Driven Bean",
                     "https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/MDB.html"))
       .withEffort(5)
       .and(Classification.as("Remove the WebLogic generic Message Driven Bean template inheritance."))

  )
  .addRule()                                                                                                 6
  .when(
    JavaClass.references("weblogic.ejb.GenericMessageDrivenBean")
             .at(TypeReferenceLocation.IMPORT)
  )

  .perform(

       Hint.withText("WebLogic Server Generic Bean Template Import")
       .with(Link.to("Message Driven Bean",
                     "https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/MDB.html"))
       .withEffort(2)
       .and(Classification.as("Remove the WebLogic generic Message Driven Bean template import.")));
}
}
~~~~

1. This line shows that Java custom rules extend `WindupRuleProvider` and override some methods.
2. This is the main method to add your custom rules.
3. `ConfigurationBuilder` is the class that permits you to add your rules with the `addRule()` method.
4. The `when` section is where you define constraints to match a given case to be analyzed. In this example, the case is the `weblogic.ejb.GenericMessageDrivenBean` inheritance used in Weblogic.
5. The `perform` section is where you add classifications and hints when the pattern matches the `when` condition. Classifications can include links to a specific URL. Hints can be added with a level of effort needed to execute the migration task.
6. This rule catches events of `weblogic.ejb.GenericMessageDrivenBean`, but as an import statement.

## Step 5. Install the Java-Based Rule Addon

1. In JBoss Developer Studio, start Forge by entering CTRL + 4 or Command + 4 (OS X).

2. Select `Build and Install an Addon`.

## Step 6. Test the Java-Based Rule Addon

1. Run Windup via Forge in JBoss Developer Studio by pressing CTRL + 4 or Command + 4 (OS X).

2. Select Windup Migrate App.

3. For the Input field, click Browse and select the jee-example-app-1.0.0.ear file you downloaded earlier.

4. For the Output field, add a location on your local workstation.

5. Define Scan Java Packages with these values:

    * com.acme
    * org.apache

6. Click Finish.

7. After executing Windup, verify that the report was generated and that the index.html file is available.

8. Find the com.acme.anvil.service.jms.LogEventSubscriber reference and open itâ€™s specific report.

9. Observe that there are now two hints and two classifications for a total of seven story points.

# Conclusion
