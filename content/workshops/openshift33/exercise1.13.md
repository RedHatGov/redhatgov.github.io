### What's A/B Testing?
A/B testing is **NOT** blue-green deployments. A/B testing is a way of testing features in your application for various reasons like usability, popularity, observability, etc, and how those factors influence the bottom line. Itâ€™s usually associated with UI parts of the app, but of course the backend services need to be available to do this. You can implement this with application-level switches (ie, smart logic that knows when to display certain UI controls), static switches (in the application), and also using Canary releases (as discussed below).

The difference between blue-green deployments and A/B testing is A/B testing is for measuring functionality in the app. Blue-green deployments is about releasing new software safely and rolling back predictably. You can obviously combine them: use blue-green deployments to deploy new features in an app that can be used for A/B testing.


### Let's Try It!
This demo will show how to use OpenShift's built in HAProxy capabilities to load balance across two Node.js apps.

<blockquote>Create basic node.js web app w/ git repo from a previous commit.</blockquote>

```bash
oc new-app https://github.com/kyle-benson/ocp-nodejs-demo.git#b69a1b0f0c3195baa0dbd2ff600f8bebc38c7ade --name='appa'
```

<!-- :warning: Do not create a route automatically for this exercise. -->
{{< alert warning >}} Do not create a route automatically for this exercise. {{< /alert >}}

<blockquote>Create a route to the deployed application.</blockquote>

```bash
oc expose svc/appa --name="appab" -l app=appab
```

<blockquote>Go to the terminal and begin using `curl` against the newly exposed route.</blockquote>

```bash
while true; do curl $(oc get -o jsonpath="{.spec.host}" route appab) && echo && sleep 5; done
```

<!-- :information_source: Keep this command alive (it'll be used later on in this lab). -->
**INFO:** Keep this command alive (it'll be used later on in this lab).

<blockquote>Update the current appab route annotation (optional).</blockquote>

```bash
oc annotate route/appab haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin
```

<blockquote>Create second nodejs app from new branch or updated commit.</blockquote>

```bash
oc new-app https://github.com/kyle-benson/ocp-nodejs-demo.git --name="appb"
```

<blockquote>Setup route to load balance between `appa` & `appb`.</blockquote>

Observe the previous started while loop that uses `curl`, notice anything different?
