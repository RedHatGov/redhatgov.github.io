# Add Build App Stage to Pipeline Text File

Next, you will add the Build App Stage to your pipeline.

<img src="../images/pipeline_build.png" width="900" />

The git branch step will clone the openshift-tasks project with the git branch locally from your gogs server to your jenkins node.  The jenkins node is leveraging the [git jenkins plugin][1] to communicate to gogs.

Please note that we are leveraging the eap-7 branch in our git project and not the master branch.

# Append to Jenkins Pipeline Configuration

In Builds > Pipelines > tasks-pipeline > Actions > Edit

<img src="../images/pipeline_actions_edit.png" width="900" />

Append the text below to the bottom of the Jenkins Pipeline Configuration.  Please make sure to append to the beginning of the next line.  

```
  stages {
    stage('Build App') {
      steps {
        git branch: 'eap-7', url: 'http://gogs:3000/gogs/openshift-tasks.git'
        script {
            def pom = readMavenPom file: 'pom.xml'
            version = pom.version
          }
          sh "${mvnCmd} install -DskipTests=true"
        }
      }
```

Your Jenkinsfile should look like this.

# Test Your Pipeline
If you'd like to do a test of first pipeline stage, add the following brackets at the end of your Jenkinsfile. Make sure to append to the beginning of the last line.

```
 }
}
```

Your Jenkinsfile should look like this

You should see your first stage run successfully.

# Delete Brackets
Please delete the brackets you just added once testing is complete. We can add them later if you'd like to test your pipeline as you go along.

```
 }
}

# Maven

Maven install will run through the [Maven lifecycle][2] and skip the tests.  We will execute tests later in the pipeline.

- validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
- compile - compile the source code of the project
- test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
- package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
- verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
- install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
- deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
