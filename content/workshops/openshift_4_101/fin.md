# That's it!
Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the OpenShift environment.  And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how containers and container orchestration works.  Please feel free to continue to "kick the tires" in the demo environment we've setup and explore both the web console and the oc command line client.
