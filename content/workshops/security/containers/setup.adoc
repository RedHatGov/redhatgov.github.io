Today's workshop infrastructure is being run in Amazon EC2. +
Each student will have a single instance to use. +
Each of you should have received an email.  It has the following information on it. +
Your student number will be substituted where you see this `< student# >`.
Example: if you are student 21: `http://dc17.21.redhat-fierce.io`

- Web URL for each of your EC2 instances. +

- Username and password +


If you didn't get one of these emails, let us know so we can give you the information about your lab environment.

Workshop Infrastructure




Each student's personal EC2 lab is equipped with the following:
****
*  A directory containing all files used in this workshop.

** _All nodes are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3_


.Setup Your Environment

Before we can begin doing super-cool automations and such, we've got to get a few basics out of the way.
Namely... ssh access to your EC2 nodes.



[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your ec2 instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!

End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into your node.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
