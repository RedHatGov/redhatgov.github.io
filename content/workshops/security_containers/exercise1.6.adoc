== Exercise 1.6 - Read Only Containers

== Exercise Description

Let's move on to "Read Only" Containers. This exercise will examine read-only containers and how to manage them.

*Overview*

Imagine a scenario where an application gets compromised. The first thing the
bad guy wants to do is to patch a backdoor into the application, so that the
next time the application starts up, it starts up with the backdoor in place. If
the container was read-­only it would prevent leaving a backdoor in place and be
forced to start the cycle from the beginning.

Docker added a read­only feature but it presents challenges since many
applications need to write to temporary directories like  `/run` or `/tmp` and
when these directories are read­only, the apps fail. Red Hat’s approach
leverages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs[`tmpfs`].

From Wikipedia:

*tmpfs* _is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many
Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system,
but stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device._

It's a nice solution to this problem because it eliminates data exposure on the
host.

*Bottom line: As a best practice, run all applications in production with this
mode.*

=== Step 1. Run a read-only container using the tmpfs option.

Run a read-only container and specify a few writable file systems using the
­`tmpfs` option.

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run --rm -it --name readonly --read-only --tmpfs=/run --tmpfs=/tmp rhel7.6 bash
----

=== Step 2. Test the following commands inside the container

Now, try the following. What fails and what succeeds? Why?

.Inside the container try these commands
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /newdir
----

[source,bash]
----
mkdir /run/newdir
----

[source,bash]
----
mkdir /tmp/newdir
----

=== Step 3. Exit the container

.Exit the container
[source,bash]
----
exit
