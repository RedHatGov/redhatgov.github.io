== Exercise 1.8 - SELinux

== Exercise Description

Let's move on to Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux). We will cover SELinux basics, Docker SELinux security policy and the "SELinux Coloring Book."

== Section 1: Basics of SELINUX

In this section, we’ll cover the basics of SELinux and containers. SELinux
policy prevents a lot of break out situations, where the other security
mechanisms fail. With SELinux on Docker, we write policy that says that the
container process running as `svirt_lxc_net_t` can only read/write files with
the `svirt_sandbox_file_t` label.

=== Step 1. Create the following directories.

.Setup directory and file
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/selinux
----

[source,bash]
----
cd  ~/selinux
----

[source,bash]
----
mkdir data
----

[source,bash]
----
echo "SELINUX" > data/file1.txt
----

[source,bash]
----
cat data/file1.txt
----

.Get SELinux policy
[source,bash]
----
sestatus | grep mode
----

=== Step 2. Attempt to cat out the file

.Try to cat out the file
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data fedora cat /data/file1.txt
----

This action will result in a Permission denied error.  You can see the reason by inspecting the folder’s security context:

[source,bash]
----
ls --scontext data
----

The label for the data doesn’t match the label for containers. The fix is to
apply the container label to the data by using the `chcon` tool, effectively
notifying the system that you expect these files to be consumed by containers:

=== Step 3. Find the selinux file context associated with containers.

.Find the Containers Labels
[source,bash]
----
sudo semanage fcontext --list | grep svirt
----

The containers should be running at `svirt_sandbox_file_t`

=== Step 4. Apply the container label to the data, using the `chcon` tool

.Re-label the data dir
[source,bash]
----
chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t data
----

=== Step 5. Try to cat out the file again from the container.

.Run docker again
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data fedora cat /data/file1.txt
----

=== Step 6. Append text from the container to the file

.Append text
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data fedora sh -c 'echo "Thank You For Attending" >> /data/file1.txt'
----

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -v $(pwd)/data:/data fedora cat /data/file1.txt
----

== Section 2: Docker SELinux Security Policy

The Docker SELinux security policy is similar to, and is based on, the libvirt security policy.

*libvirt Policy*

The libvirt security policy is a series of SELinux policies that defines two
methods of isolating virtual machines. Generally, virtual machines are prevented from accessing specific parts of the network. Specifically, individual virtual machines are denied access to each other's resources.

Red Hat extends the libvirt-SELinux model to Docker. The Docker SELinux role
and Docker SELinux types are based on libvirt. For example, by default, Docker
has access to /usr/var/ and some other locations, but it has complete access to
things that are labeled with svirt_sandbox_file_t.

https://www.mankier.com/8/docker_selinux - this explains the entire Docker
SELinux policy. It is not in layman’s terms, but it is complete.

`svirt_sandbox_file_t`

[source,bash]
----
system_u:system_r:svirt_lxc_net_t:s0:c186,c641
^      ^           ^          ^     ^--- unique category
|      |           |          |----  secret-level 0
|      |           |--- a shared type
|      |---SELinux role
|------ SELinux user
----


*The category system isolates containers from one another.*

If a file is labeled `svirt_sandbox_file_t`, then by default all containers can
read it. But if the containers write to a directory that has `svirt_sandbox_file_t` ownership, they write using their own category (which in
this case is `c186` , `c641`). If you start the same container twice, it will
get a new category the second time (a different category than it had the first
time).

Types can be applied to processes and to files.

== Section 3: SELinux Coloring Book

Imagine a system where we define types on objects like cats and dogs. A cat and
dog are process types:

- Cat
- Dog

image::selinux1.png[Processes]

We have a class of objects that they want to interact with which we call food.
And I want to add types to the food;

- cat_food
- dog_food

image::selinux2.png[Objects]

As a policy writer, we would define that a dog has permission to eat dog_chow
food and a cat has permission to eat cat_chow food. In SELinux we would write
this rule in policy.

- allow cat cat_chow:food eat;
- allow dog dog_chow:food eat;

image::selinux3.png[Objects]

With these rules the kernel would allow the cat process to eat food labeled
cat_chow and the dog to eat food labeled dog_chow.

And processes and objects are happy.

image::selinux4.png[Objects]


But in a SELinux system everything is denied by default. This means that if the
dog process tried to eat the cat_chow, the kernel would prevent it.
