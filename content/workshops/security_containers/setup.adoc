Today's workshop infrastructure is being run in Amazon EC2. Each student will
have a single instance to use. Each of you should have received an email.
It has the following information on it. Your student number will be substituted
where you see this `< student# >`. Example: if you are student 21:
`http://dc17.21.redhatgov.io`

- Web URL for each of your EC2 instances.
- Username and password

If you didn't get one of these emails, let us know so we can give you the
information about your lab environment.

== Workshop Infrastructure

Each student's personal EC2 lab is equipped with the following:

*  A directory containing all files used in this workshop.
** _All nodes are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.3_

== Setup Your Environment

Before we can begin doing super-cool automations and such, we've got to get a
few basics out of the way. Namely... ssh access to your EC2 nodes.

[IMPORTANT]
===============================================================================
Be sure you can log in to your ec2 instances.  If you can't log in start
shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!
===============================================================================

== End Result

At this point, everyone should have logged into your node.  If you haven't,
let us know so we can get you fixed up.
