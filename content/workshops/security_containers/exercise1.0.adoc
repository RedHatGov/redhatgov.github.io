== Exercise 1.0 - Intro to Cockpit

== Exercise Description
In this workshop, you will learn to navigate Cockpit and examine its features and capabilities.

=== What is Cockpit?

A remote manager for GNU/Linux servers

http://cockpit-project.org/[Cockpit] is a server manager that makes it easy to
administer your GNU/Linux servers via a web browser.

Cockpit makes it easy for any sysadmin to perform simple tasks, such as
administering storage, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started
via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in
the terminal, it can be seen in the Cockpit journal interface.

You can monitor and administer several servers at the same time. Just add them
with a single click and your machines will look after its buddies.

=== Cockpit and Docker are compatible

Cockpit makes it easy to monitor and administer Docker containers running on Cockpit-managed servers such as Project Atomic hosts. Some of the capabilities include:


- Monitoring resources consumed by containers
- Adjusting resources available to containers (Resource limits are enforced by the CGroup subsystem in the Linux kernel.)
- Adjusting CPU shares
- Assigning memory limits
- More CGroup policy controls to come
- Stopping, Starting, Deleting and Committing container instances
- Running and Deleting container images


== Section 1: Accessing the Cockpit web UI

=== Step 1. Use the following URL to access the Cockpit console on your node. Your instructor will provide a workshop name and student number. Enter this information in the appropriate space, within the URL.

[source,bash]
----
{{< uri2partfqdn "https://" ":9090" >}}
----

=== Step 2. Log in to Cockpit

.Login to Cockpit
[source,bash]
----
Username: ec2-user

Password: <to be provided>
----

After logging in, you should see the Cockpit web UI.

== Section 2: Navigate the Cockpit tool and examine its capabilities

=== Step 1. Examine the System display. Navigate using the left-side menu.

*System:* Shows information about the system that Cockpit is running on. This
includes CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic, as well as
hardware and operating system details.

[source,bash]
----
Click:  Show Fingerprints | System Time | Power Options | Performance Profile
----

=== Step 2. Examine  Services by clicking the System Services tab at the top of the display.

*System Services:* Shows the systemd services running on the Cockpit server. You can
see which are active/enabled or inactive. You can also see other systemd
features: Targets, sockets, timers, and paths.

[source,bash]
----
Click:  Targets | System Services | Sockets | Timers | Paths
----

=== Step 3. Examine the Containers and images. Navigate to "Containers" using the left-side menu.

*Containers:* Lists all images available on the system, all running and
non-running containers, combined CPU & memory usage graphs, and a storage
usage bar.

.Click to Launch an image
[source,bash]
----
Click: Get new image
----

=== Step 4. Search For & Download Fedora

Use the following commandline to search for and download Fedora.

[source,bash]
----
Search: fedora -> download
----

image::search.png[Search for Fedora]

=== Step 5. Run the Fedora image simply by clicking 'Run'.

[source,bash]
----
Click: Run
----

image::run.png[Run the Fedora image]

Then, add a command to run the image. ("Sleep" is a generic enough command.)

[source,bash]
----
Command: sleep 999
----

=== Step 6. View metadata

Click on the newly created container to view all of the metadata about the
container. Shows the state, the command executed, the container and image
IDs, a timestamp, as well as the container's own terminal.

Click on the newly created container [>]

=== Step 7. Navigate to 'Tools' via the left-side menu, to examine subscriptions, accounts, diagnostics, and terminal features.

.Features and Capabilities
*Tools:* (Terminal) +
*Subscriptions:* Displays what Red Hat products are installed and subscribed. +
*Accounts:* Shows which administrative (root) and other users have accounts on
the system. +
*Diagnostic report:* Collects system configuration and diagnostics information
and prepares a report, in an XZ format. +
*Terminal:* Opens a Terminal (command line) session to the Cockpit system.
From there, you can run any commands available to the user you are logged in
as. For example, as cockpit, you could run docker commands. +

[source,bash]
----
Command:  sudo docker ps -a
----

[source,bash]
----
Click:  Stop 
----
