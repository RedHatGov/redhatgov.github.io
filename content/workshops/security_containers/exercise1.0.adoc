== Cockpit

A remote manager for GNU/Linux servers

http://cockpit-project.org/[Cockpit] is a server manager that makes it easy to
administer your GNU/Linux servers via a web browser.

Cockpit makes it easy for any sysadmin to perform simple tasks, such as
administering storage, inspecting journals and starting and stopping services.

Jumping between the terminal and the web tool is no problem. A service started
via Cockpit can be stopped via the terminal. Likewise, if an error occurs in
the terminal, it can be seen in the Cockpit journal interface.

You can monitor and administer several servers at the same time. Just add them
with a single click and your machines will look after its buddies.

== Cockpit and Docker

Cockpit also makes it easy to monitor and administer Docker containers running
on Cockpit-managed servers such as Project Atomic hosts.

- Monitor resources consumed by containers
- Adjust resources available to containers
- Resource limits enforced by the CGroup subsystem in the Linux kernel
- Adjust CPU shares
- Assign memory limits
- More CGroup policy controls to come
- Stop, Start, Delete and Commit container instances
- Run and Delete container images

=== Step 0:

image::login.png[Login to Cockpit]

.Login to Cockpit
[source,bash]
----
Username: cockpit

Password: DC17!
----

=== Step 1:

*System:* Shows information about the system that Cockpit is running on. This
includes CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O, and network traffic, as well as
hardware and operating system details.

[source,bash]
----
Show Fingerprints | System Time | Power Options | Performance Profile
----

=== Step 2:

*Services:* Shows the systemd services running on the Cockpit server. You can
see which are active/enabled or inactive. You can also see other systemd
features: Targets, sockets, timers, and paths.

[source,bash]
----
Targets | System Services | Sockets | Timers | Paths
----

=== Step 3:

*Containers:* Lists all images available on the system, all running and
non-running containers, combined CPU & memory usage graphs, and a storage
usage bar.

.Click to Launch a image
[source,bash]
----
Get new image
----

=== Step 4:

Search & Download for Fedora

[source,bash]
----
fedora, download
----

image::search.png[Search for Fedora]

=== Step 5:

Run the Fedora image

[source,bash]
----
Run
----

Add a command to run the image. Sleep is generic enough command.

[source,bash]
----
Command: sleep 999
----

=== Step 6:

Click on the newly created container and see all of the metadata about the
container. Shows the state, the command executed, the container's and image's
IDs, a timestamp, as well as the container's own terminal:

=== Step 7:

*Tools:* (Terminal) +
*Subscriptions:* Displays what Red Hat products are installed and subscribed. +
*Accounts:* Shows which administrative (root) and other users have accounts on
the system. +
*Diagnostic report:* Collects system configuration and diagnostics information
and prepares a report in an XZ format. +
*Terminal:* Opens a Terminal (command line) session to the Cockpit system.
From there, you can run any commands available to the user you are logged in
as. For example, as cockpit, you could run docker commands. +

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker ps -a
----

=== OPTIONAL

You can even change your shell to Zsh or use the popular http://ohmyz.sh/[Oh-my-zsh]
to get customized shell prompts and other cool functions.

.Cool kids use Zsh
[source,bash]
