== Exercise 1.3 - Remove setuid/setgid Binaries

== Exercise Description
This exercise covers permissions that can be set for setuid and setgid binaries and best practices for managing them.

== SETUID/SETGID Overview

There are two special permissions that can be set on executable files: Set
User ID (setuid) and Set Group ID (sgid). These permissions allow the file
being executed to be executed with the privileges of the owner or the group.
For example, if a file was owned by the root user and has the setuid bit set,
no matter who executed the file it would always run with root user privileges.

Chances are that your application does not need any elevated privileges.

disable or remove such binaries, you stop any chance of them being used for

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation[privilege escalation attacks].

=== Step 1. Find a list of binaries

To get a list of binaries with special permissions in a container image, the following syntax can be used `find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \;`. Note, no need to type this, see next command.

.Test the latest Debian image
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run debian:jessie find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; 2> /dev/null
----

.Example output
[source,bash]
----
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 40000 Mar 29  2015 /bin/mount
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 70576 Oct 28  2014 /bin/ping
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 61392 Oct 28  2014 /bin/ping6
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 40168 May 17  2017 /bin/su
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 27416 Mar 29  2015 /bin/umount
-rwxr-sr-x. 1 root shadow 35408 May 27  2017 /sbin/unix_chkpwd
-rwxr-sr-x. 1 root shadow 62272 May 17  2017 /usr/bin/chage
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 53616 May 17  2017 /usr/bin/chfn
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 44464 May 17  2017 /usr/bin/chsh
-rwxr-sr-x. 1 root shadow 22744 May 17  2017 /usr/bin/expiry
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 75376 May 17  2017 /usr/bin/gpasswd
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 39912 May 17  2017 /usr/bin/newgrp
-rwsr-xr-x. 1 root root 54192 May 17  2017 /usr/bin/passwd
-rwxr-sr-x. 1 root tty 27232 Mar 29  2015 /usr/bin/wall
----

=== Step 2. "Defang" the binaries

You can then “defang” the binaries with `chmod a-s` to remove the suid bit.
For example, you can create a defanged Debian image with the following Dockerfile:

[source,bash]
----
cd ~
----

[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/defanged-debian
----

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/defanged-debian
----

[source,bash]
----
vim Dockerfile
----

=== Step 3. Copy the Dockerfile text below and paste it into the terminal window.
Press `i` for Insert, then cut and paste `control + v`, then escape and write the file `esc`, `:wq`.

.Dockerfile
[source,bash]
----
FROM debian:jessie
RUN find / -xdev -perm +6000 -type f -exec chmod a-s {} \; || true
----

The `|| true` allows you to ignore any errors from find. The setuid and setgid
binaries run with the privileges of the owner rather than the user. These are
normally used to allow users to temporarily run with escalated privileges
required to execute a given task, such as setting a password.

=== Step 4. Build the Image

Build the new image.

.Build the image
[source,bash]
----
sudo docker build -t defanged-debian .
----

=== Step 5. Test the image

*Now Test it to see that it has been changed.*

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run --rm defanged-debian \
  find / -perm +6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; 2> /dev/null | wc
----

=== Step 6. Run the command on your RHEL host

For comparison, now do the same command on your RHEL host, with a slight modification for the most recent version of findutils.

[source,bash]
----
sudo find / -perm /6000 -type f -exec ls -ld {} \; 2> /dev/null | wc
----

It's more likely that your Dockerfile will rely on a setuid/setgid binary than
your application. Therefore, you can always perform this step near the end,
after any such calls and before changing the user (removing setuid binaries is
pointless if the application runs with root privileges).
