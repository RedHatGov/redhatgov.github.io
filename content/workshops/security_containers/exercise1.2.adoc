== Exercise 1.2 - Docker `USER`

== Exercise Description
Now that you've gotten a sense of software provenance in Dockerfiles lets take
a look at the `USER` in `Dockerfiles`.

By default, containers run as root. A container running as root
has full control of the host system. As container technology matures, more secure default
options may become available. For now, requiring root is dangerous for others
and may not be available in all environments. Your image should use the `USER`
instruction to specify a *non-root* user for containers to run as. If your
software does not create its own user, you can create a user and group in
the Dockerfile.

=== Step 1. Reusing an Image with a Non-root User

The default user in a Dockerfile is the user of the parent image. For example,
if your image is derived from an image that uses a non-root user  example:
`swuser`, then `RUN` commands in your `Dockerfile` will run as `swuser`.

If you need to run as root, you should change the user to root at the
beginning of your Dockerfile then change back to the correct user with another
`USER` instruction:

.Example Dockerfile
[source,bash]
----
FROM fedora:29

RUN groupadd -r swuser -g 433 && \
    useradd -u 431 -r -g swuser -s /sbin/nologin -c "Docker image user" swuser

USER root

RUN dnf install -y vim

USER swuser
----

*USER root*: Switch to the root user to perform actions that need elevated permissions, such as installing software via yum/dnf.

*USER swuser*: Then, switch back to a lower permissions user to run the image.

Now we can test this out by building the following `Dockerfile`

=== Step 2. Build the `Dockerfile`

.Make new directory & Build Dockerfile
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/user-test
----

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/user-test
----

[source,bash]
----
vim Dockerfile
----

[NOTE]
Copy the `Dockerfile` above. Press `i` for Insert, then cut and paste
`control + v`, then escape and write the file `esc`, `:wq`.

.Dockerfile
[source,bash]
----
FROM fedora:29

RUN groupadd -r swuser -g 433 && \
    useradd -u 431 -r -g swuser -s /sbin/nologin -c "Docker image user" swuser

USER root

RUN dnf install -y vim

USER swuser
----

=== Step 3. Build the image

When building an image, the build time is similar as before (approximately 3 minutes)

.Build the image
[source,bash]
----
sudo buildah bud -t user-test:1
----

=== Step 4. Run and Test the image

Run and test the image to see who the container is running as. What do you see?

.Run the image
[source,bash]
----
sudo podman run --rm -it user-test:1 whoami
----
