= Containers the Hard Way

== Workshop Description

This workshop will deep dive into the Linux internals that enable containers to work. Containers will be demystified so developers and admins will have a better grasp at what their favorite container engine is doing at runtime.

== Who should attend

Today's container workshop is meant for anyone who has any exposure to Linux containers, and assumes that you have run a container or two. If you have had no exposure to containers, that's fine too, just don't be shy about asking questions.

== What you will learn

- How a container is made
- Linux namespaces and how they impact running processes
- What is stored in an OCI image file
- How the container filesystem is constructed
- How the container networking stack is constructed

== Overview

We will begin with a fast overview of how different Linux utilities work together to create a sandboxed environment and run a container. We will then step through each piece one-at-a-time and explore how they work. Finally, we will put all of our acquired knowledge together to run a Fedora container as a standard user without a container runtime. No Podman or Docker!

== Your Responsibilities

Have a discussion. This will be boring if itâ€™s just us talking for over two hours.

Participate, by offering questions and sharing opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy to follow along.
