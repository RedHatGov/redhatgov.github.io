= Exercise 1.3 - Managing Updates Using the Web Console

== Exercise Description

Now that you've toured the web console, lets work through updating the system. 

== Section 1: Basic Updating

As you did in the previous section, navigate to the `Software Updates` section of the Web Console, by clicking on the `Software Updates` link, in the left-hand menu. There will then be a brief interval where `Refreshing package information` will appear, along with a progress bar. Once that completes, you can proceed with the exercise.

=== Step 1: Check for available updates

Take a look at the `Available Updates` section of the browser window.  You should see several packages listed, in a single group, like this:

You can expand the list, to see more details, by clicking on the drill-down `>` link:

In the expanded view, you can see details on what CVEs are relevant to the updates, and any associated bug IDs.  Additionally, a summary of the changes is displayed.

=== Step 2: Install updates

Once you are finished reading, click the `Install All Updates` button, to install the updated packages.

The updates will install, and while doing so, there will be information on what actions are taking place, and below that, an expandable log drill-down. Once complete, you may receive a window like this:

image::su_updates_restart.png[Software Updates, 900, caption="Figure 3: ", title="Updates Recommend a Restart"]

=== Step 2: Restart the system

Click the `Restart Now` button, to reboot your managed host, and cause the changes to take effect. You will see screens like these, while the system is rebooting:

image::su_updates_disconnected.png[Software Updates, 900, caption="Figure 5: ", title="Disconnected"]

=== Step 3: Reconnect

Wait for a couple of minutes, for the system to come back up, and then click the `Reconnect` button, to be returned to the login screen, for the web console. Login, as before.

=== Step 4: Summary

Once you are logged back in, you will again see the updates screen, with a list of the updates that you just applied. You can expand the history list, to see the details.

== Section 2: Automatic Updating

Next, let's take a look at automatic updating.  There is an `Automatic Updates` switch, at the top of the updates window.

=== Step 1: Enable Automatic Updates

Click on the switch, next to the `Automatic Updates` label. You will then see a message, telling you that the package `dnf-automatic` is needed:

image::au_install_dnf.png[Software Updates, 900, caption="Figure 7: ", title="Install the dnf-automatic Package"]

Click the `Install` button, to proceed.

=== Step 2: Configure Timing

Once the `dnf-automatic` package is installed, you can choose which updates to install, which days, and what time:

You can select from the available menus, and select any combination of the following options:

[%header,cols="1,1,1"]

|Which updates?
|What day?
|What time?

a|* Apply all updates
* Apply security updates
a|* every day
* Mondays
* Tuesdays
* Wednesdays
* Thursdays
* Fridays
* Saturdays
* Sundays
a|

* 12:00
* 13:00

* 18:00
* 19:00
* 20:00
* 21:00
* 22:00
* 23:00
|===

Set the automatic update mechanism for Fridays, to apply security updates, at 03:00.

With this simple change, your system will always be up-to-date on critical security fixes, without you having to lift a further finger!

== Summary

We've tried out the RHEL 8 web console's manual and automatic updating functionality.  Please ask any questions that seem relevant, and then we can move on to the next section.
