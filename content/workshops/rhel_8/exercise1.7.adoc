= Exercise 1.8: OpenSCAP Security Compliance Scanning

RHEL 8 makes it easy to maintain secure and compliant systems with OpenSCAP.  +
What is SCAP? +
SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a NIST project that standardizes the language for describing assessment criteria and findings.  It also provides a vulnerability rating system.  The project's home page is `https://scap.nist.gov/` +

The essential components of SCAP are:

* XCCDF: The Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
* OVAL®: Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language
* CCE™: Common Configuration Enumeration
* CPE™: Common Platform Enumeration
* CVE®: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
* CVSS: Common Vulnerability Scoring System

OpenSCAP is a project that implements tools for performing SCAP scans and remediating findings. +
You can read more about the project at `http://www.open-scap.org/` and the repository for their tools and profiles is on GitHub at `https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap/`.

== Exercise Description

In the following exercises we'll use the CLI to show how you can validate system compliance.  There are other tools as well, including a GUI utility and another for scanning container images.

== Section 1: Ensure httpd and the OpenSCAP scanner are installed

Ensure Apache httpd plus the OpenSCAP scanner and definitions are installed with the command below; it's safe to run even if the packages already exist:
[source, bash]
----
sudo yum install -y httpd openscap-scanner scap-security-guide
----
 
The ##scap-security-guide## package contains prepared system profiles for several RHEL releases and system types; they are installed under */usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content*.  +
You can get a summary of the profiles in a given definition file with the following command:
[source, bash]
----
oscap info --fetch-remote-resources /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----
Output:
....

....

Looking about half-way down, you can see that this file contains two profiles:  one for PCI-DSS and another for OSPP.  The OSPP profile is a general-purpose profile, so it's a good choice for testing.


== Section 2: Enable httpd for viewing compliance report

Run the following to enable the Apache web server and allow client access to it.

[source, bash]
----
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=http
sudo systemctl reload firewalld
sudo systemctl enable --now httpd
----

== Section 3: Perform an initial compliance scan

To perform a basic compliance scan using the OSPP profile for RHEL 8, run the following command; the profile is specified by supplying the ##Id## field from the output above:
[source, bash]
----
sudo oscap xccdf eval --fetch-remote-resources --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_ospp --results-arf /tmp/arf.xml --report /var/www/html/report.html /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel8-ds.xml
----

Once the command completes, open this link in another tab to view the resulting report:
[source, bash]
----
{{< urifqdn "http://" "node" "/report.html" >}}
----

Here's a snippet of what the report looks like:

== Section 4: Automatically remediate findings

To correct compliance issues found in the scan, we can generate a Bash shell script or an Ansible playbook automatically from the scan's findings.  To generate an Ansible playbook, run the following:

[source, bash]
----
sudo oscap xccdf generate fix --fetch-remote-resources --fix-type ansible --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > /tmp/ospp-playbook-fix.yml
----

Review the generated YAML file, ##/tmp/ospp-playbook-fix.yml##.  Note that the individual tasks are clearly named and delineated.  Once you're comfortable with it, run the playbook with:
[source, bash]
----
ansible-playbook -i localhost, -u ec2-user -b /tmp/ospp-playbook-fix.yml
----

The playbook will take several minutes to run.

// OPTIONAL:  reboot the system to enable the changes.
// [source, bash]
// ----
// sudo init 6
// ----

//change httpd listen port to 8888:
//sudo sed -i 's/^Listen.*$/Listen 0.0.0.0:8888/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
//sudo semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8888
//sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8888
//sudo systemctl reload firewalld
//systemctl enable --now httpd

// oscap Bash remediation:
//sudo oscap xccdf generate fix --fetch-remote-resources --fix-type bash --result-id "" /tmp/arf.xml > /tmp/ospp-bash-fix.sh
//sudo chmod a+x /tmp/ospp-bash-fix.sh
//sudo /tmp/ospp-bash-fix.sh
