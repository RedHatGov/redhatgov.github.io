= Wrap Up and Q&A

That wraps up what we have planned for today.  We hope you've enjoyed learning about all the goodness that is RHEL 8!

What do you think? How can we help you understand new RHEL features better?

//Before you leave, check out the *Resources* page that is part of this guide.  There, you can find a ton of links that will further your RHEL education.

This *Participant Guide* will remain active for the next two weeks.  Please take advantage of it by downloading RHEL8 and installing a test host or VM back at your organization.

Thank you for your time and participation!
