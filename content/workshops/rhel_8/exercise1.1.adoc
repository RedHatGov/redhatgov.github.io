= Exercise 1.1 - What's New in RHEL 8

== Application streams

Application streams deliver user space packages on a cadence that makes sense for the package rather than as a monolithic distribution. Streams also allow the consolidation of previous distribution channels to a single place.

== Red Hat Insights

Red Hat Insights is included with your Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® 8 subscription. It helps provide a security-focused, reliable, efficient, and scalable infrastructure environment.

== Image builder

Image builder lets customers build images from source RPMs that are deployable to multiple targets quickly and simply, and provides fine-grained control and visibility in to what’s included in a particular image and its history. It allows customers to manage the life cycle of their image catalogs independently of the release of new packages.

== New container tools

New container tools—Podman, Buildah, and Skopeo—form a strong foundation to support your container image and container needs.

== Web console

The web console provides a single browser-based interface to all of the available tools and improves the user experience for new users and experienced administrators alike.

== Virtual data optimizer

This virtual data optimizer provides volume-level compression and data deduplication to eliminate data redundancy and increase effective storage capacity for new and existing devices.

== System roles

System roles allow customers to configure subsystems using Ansible.® They deliver a layer of abstraction at the automation level, providing a common syntax across multiple major versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

== Systemwide crypto policies

Creating a systemwide crypto policy allows admins to set the acceptable algorithms in multiple sources with a single configuration.
