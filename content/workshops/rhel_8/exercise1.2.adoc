= Exercise 1.2 - Tour of the Web Console


== Exercise Description

To get started, we will take a tour of the web console. The web console (called `cockpit`) will be your primary interactive interface to RHEL. The console has a number of functions that allow you to manage most aspects of the installation.

=== Section 1: Overview of the web console

Here is a quick overview of all the available modules:

The various functional sections can be seen in `Figure 1`, and are: +
{empty} +

As you can see, many of the day-to-day management of a RHEL system can be accomplished without touching the terminal. This makes RHEL 8 the easiest-to-live-with release, yet!

Next, let's proceed to a more detailed examination of each module. Please click through the web console on your host, as you read the explanations, here.

=== Section 2: System Module

image::cockpit_system.png[caption="Figure 2: ", title='Web Console System Module', 500]

The system module is the main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console. It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

* hardware type
** detailed system hardware data is available, from the link on the main page
* asset tag
* machine ID
* operating system
** when updates to the system are available, an "updates available" link will be present
* SSH keys
** key fingerprints for all created 'root' keys
* host name
** the system's name may be changed, and an alias may be added
* domain
** the system may be added to an LDAP/AD domain
* time and date
** time zone and automatic or manual time and date setting can be done
* performance profile
** the system's performance profile may be changed

Additionally, there are graphs that show the system's CPU, memory, disk, and network utilization.  Each graph may be enlarged, by clicking its associated link.

=== Section 3: Logs Module

image::cockpit_01_logs.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title='Web Console Logs Module', 500]

The logs module provides date-sorted view of recent system log entries.  You can change the date or apply basic filters using the pull-down menus at the top of the page. 

=== Section 4: Storage Module

image::cockpit_02_storage.png[caption="Figure 4: ", title='Web Console Storage Module', 500]

The storage module provides graphs of current storage performance.  It also lists local and network-mounted filesystems, plus recent storage-related log entries.

=== Section 5: Networking Module

image::cockpit_03_networking.png[caption="Figure 5: ", title='Web Console Networking Module', 500]

The network module contains performance graphs similar to the storage module.  Additionally, it shows the configuration of your network interfaces, identifies unused interfaces, and provides access to, and control of, the system firewall.

=== Section 5: Podman Containers Module

image::cockpit_04_podman.png[caption="Figure 6: ", title='Web Console Podman Containers Module', 500]

This module provides control of local podman containers and their corresponding images.

=== Section 6: Virtual Machines Module

image::cockpit_05_vm.png[caption="Figure 7: ", title='Web Console Virtual Machines Module', 500]

The main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console is the system module.  It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

=== Section 7: Accounts Module

image::cockpit_06_accounts.png[caption="Figure 8: ", title='Web Console Accounts Module', 500]

The accounts module allows you to create and modify local user accounts.

=== Section 8: Services Module

image::cockpit_07_services.png[caption="Figure 9: ", title='Web Console Services Module', 500]

The services module allows basic administration of systemd objects, including system services.

=== Section 9: Session Recording Module

image::cockpit_08_sr.png[caption="Figure 10: ", title='Web Console Session Recording Module', 500]

This module provides management of recorded terminal sessions. 

=== Section 10: Applications Module

image::cockpit_09_applications.png[caption="Figure 11: ", title='Web Console Applications Module', 500]

The main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console is the system module.  It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

=== Section 11: Diagnostic Reports Module

image::cockpit_10_dr.png[caption="Figure 12: ", title='Web Console Diagnostic Reports Module', 500]

The main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console is the system module.  It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

=== Section 12: Kernel Dump Module

image::cockpit_11_kd.png[caption="Figure 13: ", title='Web Console Kernel Dump Module', 500]

The main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console is the system module.  It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

=== Section 13: SELinux Module

image::cockpit_12_selinux.png[caption="Figure 14: ", title='Web Console SELinux Module', 500]

=== Section 14: Software Update Module

image::cockpit_13_su.png[caption="Figure 15: ", title='Web Console Kernel Dump Module', 500]

The main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console is the system module.  It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

=== Section 15: Subscriptions Module

image::cockpit_14_subscriptions.png[caption="Figure 16: ", title='Web Console Subscriptions Module', 500]

The main screen that you see, when you first login to the web console is the system module.  It contains an overview of the system, including the below sections:

=== Section 16: Terminal Module

image::cockpit_15_terminal.png[caption="Figure 17: ", title='Web Console Terminal Module', 500]

The terminal module provides command-line access to the system, similar to an SSH session.  Section 16.1 has some example commands to try if you'd like to test it out.

==== Section 16.1: Example terminal usage

===== Example 1: Use the following command to pull a RHEL image from the Red Hat repository:

[source, bash]
----
podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
----

Now if you return to the Podman Containers tab (above, in Section 5), you should see this image listed.  You'll see more of podman later in Exercise 4.

===== Example 2: Try the Skopeo command

Skopeo provides the ability to inspect container images stored in a registry. The Inspect feature displays details of the selected image. The 'skopeo inspect' command's ability to list all the tags associated with a selected image is a benefit over the docker tool.

[source, bash]
----
skopeo inspect docker://registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi-minimal
----

===== Example 3: List firewall rules

nft is the nftables utility.  Similar to ''iptables -L'', the following lists the system's active firewall ruleset:

[source, bash]
----
nft list ruleset
----

=== Conclusion

The web console has a lot of new functionality, in version 8 of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Hopefully, this brief (!) overview has demonstrated that, and given you a taste of how easily systems may be managed, with this new tool.
