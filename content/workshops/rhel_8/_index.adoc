= Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Workshop

== Workshop Description

This workshop will cover the features, specifications and improvements that comprise the release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux Version 8 (RHEL 8).  RHEL 8 brings many improvements over previous releases, including:

* Application streams, which enables the use of bleeding edge interpreters, compilers and libraries, while maintaining full backwards compatibility and stability of the system
* The web console has been completely overhauled, and significant new features have been added
** Session recording capability has been added to the web console
* Image builder provides the easy creation of customized RHEL installation images
* The system package management tool, YUM, has been enhanced with DNF technology, providing significant performance improvements
* The `System Purpose` tool has been enhanced to automatically tune system performance for the usage of the system
* There is a new `update-crypto-policies` tool, which applies cryptograhic polices system-wide
** TLS, IPsec, DNSSEC, Kerberos, and SSH protocols are covered
* The system Python interpreter has been updated to version 3.6
* System firmware updating is now built into the GNOME Software tool, using fwupd
* The system firewall has been upgraded to 'nftables' from 'iptables', which provides significantly better performance.  The firewall manager, 'firewalld', remains the same

== Your Responsibilities

Have a Discussion. This will be boring if itâ€™s just us, up here talking for over 4 hours.

Participate. We are going to cut you loose with RHEL, in just a little while. Have questions. Have opinions.

Hopefully you have your laptop with you. If not, please find a shoulder-surfing buddy. See? Not only can we dig into RHEL, but you can make a new friend!
