= Exercise 2.0 - Installing Ansible Tower

== Exercise Description

In this exercise, we are going to get Ansible Tower installed on your control node.


=== Step 1: Change directories

Change directories to /tmp

[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp
----

=== Step 2: Download Red Hat Ansible Tower

Download the latest Ansible Tower package

[source,bash]
----
curl -O https://releases.ansible.com/ansible-tower/setup/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
----

=== Step 3: Untar and unzip the package file

[source,bash]
----
tar xvfz /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-latest.tar.gz
----

=== Step 4: Change directories

Change directories into the Ansible Tower setup package

[source,bash]
----
cd /tmp/ansible-tower-setup-*/
----

=== Step 5: Open inventory file

Using an editor of your choice, open the inventory file

[source,bash]
----
vim inventory
----

=== Step 6: Identify variables

Fill a few variables out in an inventory file: `admin_password`, `pg_password`, `rabbitmq_password`

[subs=+quotes]
----
[tower]
localhost ansible_connection=local

[database]

[all:vars]
admin_password=*'ansibleWS'*

pg_host=''
pg_port=''

pg_database='awx'
pg_username='awx'
pg_password=*'ansibleWS'*
pg_sslmode='prefer'  # set to 'verify-full' for client-side enforced SSL

# Isolated Tower nodes automatically generate an RSA key for authentication;
# To disable this behavior, set this value to false
# isolated_key_generation=true


# SSL-related variables

# If set, this will install a custom CA certificate to the system trust store.
# custom_ca_cert=/path/to/ca.crt

# Certificate and key to install in nginx for the web UI and API
# web_server_ssl_cert=/path/to/tower.cert
# web_server_ssl_key=/path/to/tower.key

# Server-side SSL settings for PostgreSQL (when we are installing it).
# postgres_use_ssl=False
# postgres_ssl_cert=/path/to/pgsql.crt
# postgres_ssl_key=/path/to/pgsql.key
----

=== Step 7: Run setup

Run the Ansible Tower setup script

[source,bash]
----
sudo ./setup.sh
----

[NOTE]
Step 7 will take approx. 10-15 minutes to complete.  This may be a good time to take a break.


=== Step 8: Confirm results

At this point, your Ansible Tower installation should be complete.
You can access your Tower workshop (not forgetting that *workshopname* is the name of your workshop, and *#* is your student number) at:


[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn "https://" "tower" "" >}}
----

=== Ensuring Installation Success

You know you were successful if you are able to browse to your Ansible Tower's url (_control node's IP address_) and get something like this
