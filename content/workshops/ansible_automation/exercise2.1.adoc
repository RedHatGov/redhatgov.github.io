= Exercise 2.1 - Configuring Red Hat Ansible Tower



== Exercise Description

In this exercise, we are going to configure Red Hat Ansible Tower, so that we can run a playbook.

There are a number of constructs in the Ansible Tower UI that enable multi-tenancy, notifications, scheduling, etc.
However, we are only going to focus on the key concepts required for this workshop today.


* Credentials
* Projects
* Inventory
* Job Template


== Section 1: Logging into Ansible Tower and installing the license key


=== Step 1: Log in

To log in, use the username `admin` and and the password `ansibleWS`.



image::ansible-lab-figure01-logon-screen.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title="Ansible Tower Login Screen"]


After you login, you will be prompted to request an Ansible Tower license, or browse for an existing license file



image::at_lic_prompt.png[caption="Figure 4: ", title="Uploading a License"]
:cred_url: http://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/credentials.html#credential-types



=== Step 2: Request workshop license

In a separate browser tab, browse to https://www.ansible.com/workshop-license to request a workshop license.

=== Step 3: Upload Ansible Tower workshop license

Back in the Ansible Tower UI, choose BROWSE image:at_browse.png[LicB,45,25] and upload your recently downloaded license file into Ansible Tower.

=== Step 4: Accept license agreement

Select "_I agree to the End User License Agreement_".

=== Step 5: Submit

Select SUBMIT image:at_submit.png[Sub,35,25]

// === Step 3: Request a workshop license

// In a separate browser tab, browse to https://www.ansible.com/workshop-license to request a workshop license.

// At the commandline in your Ansible Tower instance download the encrypted license file via the curl command.

// [source,bash]
// ----
// curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/ansible-tower-workshop-license/license
// ----

// Then Decrypt the license file via Ansible Vault.
// **The instructor should provide the password**

// [source,bash]
// ----
// ansible-vault decrypt license --ask-vault-pass
//
// ...

// Vault password:
// ----

// Now use curl to POST the license to the Tower API endpoint.

// [source,bash]
// ----
// curl -k https://localhost/api/v1/config/ \
//      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
//      -X POST \
//      --data @license \
//      --user admin:ansibleWS
//
// ----






== Section 2: Creating a credential

Credentials are utilized by Ansible Tower for authentication when launching jobs against machines,
synchronizing with inventory sources, and importing project content from a version control system.

There are many link:{cred_url}[types of credentials] including machine, network, and various cloud providers.  In this workshop, we are using a *machine* credential.


=== Step 1: Select Credentials
Select CREDENTIALS, from the left-side menu bar.   image:at_credentials.png[Cred,100,35]

=== Step 2: Select Add

Select ADD   image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3: Complete the Ansible Tower Credentials form

Complete the form, using the following entries and your private Ansible Tower SSH key.  When you paste the key in the `PRIVATE KEY` field, make sure to include the `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` and `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----` lines.

----
cat ~/.ssh/{{< span2 "prefix" "example" "-tower" >}} && echo
----

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Credential
|DESCRIPTION|Machine credential for run job templates during workshop
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|TYPE|Machine
|USERNAME| ec2-user
|PRIVILEGE ESCALATION|sudo
|PRIVATE KEY|paste in secret key

=== Step 4: Save

Select SAVE  image:at_save.png[Save,35,25] +



== Section 3: Creating a Project

A Project is a logical collection of Ansible playbooks, represented in Ansible Tower.
You can manage playbooks and playbook directories, by either placing them manually
under the Project Base Path on your Ansible Tower server, or by placing your playbooks into
a source code management (SCM) system supported by Ansible Tower, including Git, Subversion, and Mercurial.

=== Step 1: Open a new project

Select PROJECTS image:at_projects.png[projects,125,35].

=== Step 2: Add the project

Select ADD   image:at_add.png[Add,35,25]

=== Step 3: Complete the Project form

Complete the form using the following entries:

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Project
|DESCRIPTION|workshop playbooks
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|SCM TYPE|Git
|SCM URL| https://github.com/ajacocks/lightbulb
|SCM BRANCH|
|SCM UPDATE OPTIONS
a|

- [*] Clean
- [*] Delete on Update
- [*] Update Revision on Launch

=== Step 4: Save

Select SAVE image:at_save.png[Save,35,25]




== Section 4: Creating an Inventory

An inventory is a collection of hosts, against which jobs may be launched.
Inventories are divided into groups and these groups contain the actual hosts.

Groups may be sourced *manually*, by entering host names into Ansible Tower, or from one of Ansible Towerâ€™s supported cloud providers.

An Inventory can also be *imported* into Ansible Tower using the `tower-manage` command. This is how we are going to add an inventory for this workshop.


=== Step 1: Navigate to Inventories main link

Select INVENTORIES    image:at_inv_icon.png[Inv, 100,30]

=== Step 2: Add a new inventory

Select ADD image:at_add.png[Add,35,25], and then select Inventory.

=== Step 3: Complete the Inventory form

Complete the form, using the following entries:

|===
|NAME |Ansible Workshop Inventory
|DESCRIPTION|workshop hosts
|ORGANIZATION|Default
|===



image::at_inv_create.png[Cred_Detail,900,caption="Figure 7: ",title="Create an Inventory"]



=== Step 4: Save

Select SAVE  image:at_save.png[Save,35,25]

=== Step 5: Switch back to your terminal session

Switch back to your terminal session.  If by any chance you closed the Red Hat Web Console browser window, open a new one with the URL shown, below:

[source,bash]
----
{{< urifqdn "https://" "tower" ":9090/system/terminal" >}}
----




=== Step 6: Import an existing inventory

Use the `tower-manage` command to import an existing inventory.  (_Be sure to replace <username> with your actual username._)
----
sudo tower-manage inventory_import --source=/home/ec2-user/hosts --inventory-name="Ansible Workshop Inventory"
----

You should see output similar to the following:



image::at_tm_stdout.png[Cred_Detail,900,caption="Figure 8: ",title="Importing an inventory with tower-manage"]




Feel free to browse your inventory in Ansible Tower, by selecting *Hosts*. image:at_inv_hosts.png[hosts,200,50]

You should now notice that the inventory has been populated with each each of hosts and corresponding inventory.

image::at_inv_group.png[Cred_Detail,900,caption="Figure 9: ",title="Inventory with Groups"]




=== End Result

At this point, we are working with our basic configuration of Ansible Tower.  In Exercise 2.2, we will be solely focused on creating and running a job template so you can see Ansible Tower in action.
