= Exercise 4.0 - Update to a new container on OpenShift and field to edge

== Exercise Description
Now that we can pull a container from OpenShift and move it to an edge node via Ansible Automation, let's repeat the process with a new release using the artifacts that we created.

== Let's Login to the Web Console
In your browser & in a new tab, connect to the Red Hat OpenShift console

Change *GIT_REVISION* from "*release1*" to "*release2*" and hit *[Start]*

|===
|GIT_VERSION|release2
|===

Once the deploy is complete, you will see that the edge workload on Red Hat OpenShift is on release2 

Select *Topology* in the left menu
