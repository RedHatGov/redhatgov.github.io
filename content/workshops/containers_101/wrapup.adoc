== Wrap Up, Q&A, and Free Style

That wraps up what we have planned for today.

What do you think? How can we better help you understand Linux container concepts?

For more in depth overview and examples for working with containers and RHEL check out link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-enterprise-linux-atomic-host/7/single/getting-started-with-containers/[this link].

Thank you for your time and participation!
