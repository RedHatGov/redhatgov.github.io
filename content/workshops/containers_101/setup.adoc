Today's workshop infrastructure is being run in Amazon EC2.
Each student will have one instances to use.
Each of you should have received an email.  It has the following information on it.

1. Web based ssh access URL for your EC2 instances.

workshopname.<student#>.redhatgov.io:8888/wetty/ssh/ec2-user
----

Where `<student#>` is the number that has been assigned to you by the instructor.

If you didn't get one of these emails, let us know so we can give you the information about your lab environment.

Be sure you can log in to your ec2 instance.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!
{{< /alert >}}

At this point, everyone should have logged into your node.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
