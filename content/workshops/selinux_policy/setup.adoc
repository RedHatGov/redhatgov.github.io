= Workshop Lab Setup


== What you will learn: Cockpit (Browser-based Admin Interface)

This lab provides a quick tour of the browser based admin interface client 'Cockpit'. To help you get familiar with lab environment along with some key terminology we will use in subsequent lab content.


== Accessing Cockpit

Use this URL to access the Cockpit node, just change the workshop name (if applicable). Ask your instructor for the workshop name.

The login screen looks like this:

After logging in, you should see the main screen:

Now, let's do a quick tour of Cockpit tabs that we will be using in this workshop.

First, click on the `SELinux` link, in the panel on the left side of the screen.  You should see a panel like this:

image::RHEL9.5-cockpit-selinux.png[caption="Figure 3: ", title='Cockpit SELinux Panel', 500]

In this panel, you can enable or disable the enforcement of the SELinux policy, by placing the whole system in `permissive` or `enforcing` mode.  We will talk further about this, later on in the workshop.  Also, in the lower section of the window, we can review SELinux Access Control Errors, also known as `AVCs`.  Again, we will discuss that later.

The last part of cockpit that we need to review is the `Terminal` panel.  Please click on the `Terminal` link, in the panel on the left:

This is where we will be doing most of our work in this workshop.  You can copy and paste from the panel, using the UNIX/X11 standard of highlighting text to copy it, and clicking the middle button of your mouse to paste it.  Go ahead and try it out!

[IMPORTANT]
Be sure you can log in to your instances.  If you can't log in start shouting, loudly, and waving your hands!

== End Result

At this point, you should have logged into your node.  If you haven't, let us know so we can get you fixed up.
