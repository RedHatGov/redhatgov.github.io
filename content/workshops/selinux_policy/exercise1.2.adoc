= Exercise 1.2 - SELinux Contexts

== Exercise Description

All processes and files are labeled with an SELinux context.  The context contains information that SELinux needs to make control decisions.  Contexts contain user, role, type, and level information,

=== Step 1: Examine a context

To get started, let's check the context of a file in the `ec2-user` user's home directory:

{{< highlight bash >}}
ls -Z ~ec2-user/.vimrc
{{< /highlight >}}

[source,bash]
----
unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0 /home/ec2-user/.vimrc
----

As a side note, the `-Z` flag is present, in a wide variety of common CLI tools, including *ls* and *ps*. That flag indicates that SELinux context information should be displayed. 

Following the standard UNIX permissions, user and group information, the SELinux context attached to the file is displayed.  The fields are SELinux user (`unconfined_u`), role (`object_r`), type (`user_home_t`), and level (`s0`).  

The SELinux user is not the same as the UNIX user, as it solely exists to associate a UNIX user to a set of roles.  This allows UNIX users to be constrained by SELinux policy.  In this case the `unconfined_u` user means that the user is mapped to the `__default__` SELinux login.  This means that the user is allowed to launch any application that standard filesystem permissions allow.  However, if that application has a defined domain transition, a confined domain will still apply to it.

=== Step 2: Domain transitions

To demonstrate the difference between confined and unconfined processes, let's launch an application which doesn't have a defined domain transition:

{{< highlight bash >}}
yes >/dev/null &
ps -Z | grep yes
{{< /highlight >}}

[source,bash]
----
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 29448 pts/0 00:00:07 yes
----

Here, you can see that the `yes` process is labeled with the `unconfined_t` domain, indicating that it still has full `root` privileges, and can do whatever it wishes.

On the other hand, if we launch the `passwd` utility, we will see a different story:

{{< highlight bash >}}
kill %1
ps -Z | grep yes
passwd ec2-user >/dev/null &
ps -Z | grep passwd
{{< /highlight >}}

[source,bash]
----
unconfined_u:unconfined_r:passwd_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023 29498 pts/0 00:00:00 passwd

[1]+  Stopped                 passwd ec2-user > /dev/null
----

See that the third field is `passwd_t`, indicating that the `passwd` process has been confined by the `passwd_t` domain.

Let's kill that hanging `passwd` process, and move on:

{{< highlight bash >}}
kill %1
{{< /highlight >}}

This changing of the context, when an application in SELinux's ruleset is launched, is called a `domain transition`.

=== Step 3: Useful utility #1: restorecon

If I had to suggest to a new SELinux user the one thing that they should remember (no, it's not `setenforce 0`!), it'd be `restorecon`.  Restorecon will reset the SELinux context to what is defined in the system's context database.

To try this out, let's purposefully set the context incorrectly on our example SELinux AVC log:

{{< highlight bash >}}
chcon -t httpd_sys_content_t ./testaudit
ls -Z ./testaudit
{{< /highlight >}}

[source,bash]
----
system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 ./testaudit
----

And we can change it back, magically, with restorecon.  Note that this would have fixed the problem reported in our test AVC, by setting the context to `httpd_sys_content_t`:

{{< highlight bash >}}
restorecon -v ./testaudit
ls -Z ./testaudit
{{< /highlight >}}

[source,bash]
----
Relabeled /root/testaudit from system_u:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0 to system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0

-rw-------. root root system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0 ./testaudit
----

I also slipped in `chcon`, which you can use to temporarily change the context on a file.
