# That's it!
Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the OpenStack environment.  And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how Infrastructure-as-a-Service works.  Please feel free to continue to "kick the tires" in the demo environment we've setup and explore both the web console and the command line clients. These will remain running for a few days after the workshop.

# Get even deeper

Here are some good resources to continue learning OpenStack:

* [OpenStack Foundation](https://www.openstack.org/)
* [TryStack.org - The easiest way to try OpenStack](http://trystack.org/)
* [RDO Project - Our midstream open source OpenStack for RHEL variants](https://www.rdoproject.org/)

There are two ways to get started with RDO: TripleO Quickstart and PackStack

* [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/)
* [PackStack](https://www.rdoproject.org/install/quickstart/)
