#  Exercise 1.5: Examine Infrastructure Provisioning

## Exercise Description
Learn to provision infrastructures, using Red Hat CloudForms. CloudForms enables provisioning and management across physical, virtual, and private cloud platforms.

### Red Hat CloudForms Infrastructure Provisioning process (Summary)

In Red Hat CloudForms, when a virtual machine or cloud instance is provisioned, it goes through multiple phases. First, the request must be made. The request includes ownership information, tags, virtual hardware requirements, the operating system, and any customization of the request. Second, the request must go through an approval phase, either automatic or manual. Finally, the request is executed.

Execution consists of pre-processing and post-processing. Pre-processing acquires IP addresses for the user, creates VMDB instances, and creates the virtual machine based on information in the request. Post-processing activates the VMDB instance.

## Infrastructure Provisioning

Step 1: > Select **Compute** → **Infrastructure** → **Virtual Machines**.

Step 2: On the left, in the **VMs** accordion, select **All VMs & Templates**.

Step 3: On the right, click <img title="CloudForms Infrastructure VMs" src="../images/cfme-lifecycle-icon.png" /> (**Lifecycle**).

Step 4: Select <i class="fa fa-plus-circle fa-lg" aria-hidden="true"></i> (**Provision VMs**), and observe the following.

*Template List*

The **Provider** column shows some templates are from Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager and others are from VMware.

Step 5: Select any template and click **Continue**.

*Provision Virtual Machines*

*   In the **Request** tab, fill out all the fields.
*   In the **Catalog** tab, set the VM Name.
*   In the **Environment** tab, check **Choose Automatically**.
*   In the **Network** tab, choose a **vLan**.
*   Click **Submit**.

Step 7: On the resulting screen, observe that your provision request appears in a list. If you are in an environment with real infrastructure, you can monitor this area for the status of the VM build.
