# Exercise 1.16 - Explore Containers

## Exercise Description

In this exercise we will take a general overview of containers and how you will work with them in Red Hat CloudForms.

First, it is important to know the definition of a container: A container is an application sandbox that wraps your software in a complete filesystem, containing everything it needs to run.

## Exploring Containers

### Step 1. Go to **Compute** → **Containers**.

### Step 2. Select a **Container Provider**.

This page displays quantitative details about your containers, such as the number of nodes, containers, registries, projects, pods, services, images, and routes, as well as graphs displaying the nodes and network utilization.

### Step 3. Click each element to see a list and then click the individual list items, to view the details for that item.

This lab does not contain any Volumes or Builds, but you can see them in a live environment.

### Step 4. Go to **Compute** → **Containers** → **Topology**.

### Step 5. Explore the filtering features by activating and deactivating any of the following items on the map:

*   Containers
*   Hosts
*   Nodes
*   Pods
*   Services
*   Replicators
*   Routes
*   VMs
