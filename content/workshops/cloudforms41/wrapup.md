# That's it!

Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the CloudForms environment.  And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how CloudForms simplifies IT, providing unified management and operations in a hybrid environment.

As your IT infrastructure progresses from traditional virtualization toward an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) model, CloudForms evolves, protecting your investments and providing consistent user experience and functionality.

Please feel free to continue to "kick the tires" in the demo environment we've setup and explore the web console.


# Get even deeper
