# Exercise 1.15 - Explore Network Topology

## Exercise Description
When working in complex provider environments, with many objects, Red Hat CloudForms topology feature can be extremely useful, to quickly view and categorize information. The topology view enables you to view a container provider’s objects, plus their details, such as the properties, status, and relationships to other provider objects. In this exercise, you will learn how to explore the topology of a network.
