## Exercise 1.0 - API Design

### Import an OpenAPI Specification using APIcurio Studio

* Duration: 10 mins
* Audience: Developers, Architects

## Exercise Description

As APIs become more widespread in the enterprise, consistent design and usage is critically important to improve reusability. The more reusable APIs are, the less friction there is for other internal or external teams to make progress. Having design standards and tools baked into the API development and maintenance process is a very powerful way to enable this consistency.

As a developer, we need to be familiar with API Design even though it's not our core capability.  Therefore, in this exercise we will review Red Hat's API Designer product, APIcurio, so that we're familiar with its capabilities only.

### Why Red Hat?

Red Hat is one of the founding members of the Linux Foundation Open API Initiative (OAI), which produces the leading standard for REST API specifications. Red Hat consistently uses this standard throughout its tooling, starting with the Apicurio Studio API Design editor.

## Section 1: Importing APIs with APIcurio Studio

### Step 1. Open a browser window and navigate to apicur.io

### Step 2. Log in using your designated [user and password](#environment).

### Step 3. From the Dashboard page, click **APIs** in the left-side navigation menu.

### Step 4. Click **Import API**.

### Step 5. Import the API created by your friendly Citizen Integrator:

    * Import Type: **Import From URL**
    * Url: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epe105/dayinthelife-integration/master/docs/labs/developer-track/resources/Locations.yaml`

    <br><img src="../images/design-04.png "Import API" width="900" /><br><br>

### Step 6. Click **Import API**.

### Step 7. Finally, click **Edit API** to walk through your newly imported API.

## Section 2: Verifying APIs

You are now in the main screen to edit your APIs. APIcurio's Editor is a graphical, form-based editor, which makes it different from other API editors. With Apicurio, you don't need master in and out all the details of the **OpenAPI Specification**. It enables you to design beautiful, functional APIs with zero coding skills needed.

Let's start verifying your API.

### Step 1. First, verify data definitions for the API. Click the `location/phone{id}` link under the *Paths*.

    <br><img src="../images/design-15.png "Add Definition" width="900" /><br><br>

### Step 2. Notice that this API path has a single path parameter (`id` defined as an `int32`) and a single GET operation defined.  

### Step 3. Click the GET operation, then click the location drop-down, which is part of the 200 OK response.

    <br><img src="../images/design-16.png "Definition Name" width="900" /><br><br>

### Step 4. Notice that this API path has a single response defined (a `200 OK` response) and the type that is returned is a `location` object.

    <br><img src="../images/design-17.png "Definition Data Types" width="900" /><br><br>

## Section 3: Verify the location object

### Step 1. From under the *Data Types* section, click the `</> location` object link.

Note, the right side of the screen displays the properties that support the object.

    <br><img src="../images/design-06.png "Add Path" width="900" /><br><br>

### Step 2. Click the source link and notice that we have both YAML and JSON schemas generated by our object design:

    <br><img src="../images/design-07.png "Path" width="900" /><br><br>

## Section 4: Verify the /locations path

Click the **/locations** path.  Then click the source tab.  Notice that we have both a GET and POST request defined, together with a couple of example requests.  Using a POST method, we can insert a new record into our sample database with Fuse.

*Congratulations!* You have imported your first API definition based on the OpenAPI Specification  using Red Hat's Apicurio.

## Steps Beyond

So, you want more? Did you notice the link **source** when editing the *Paths* or the *Definitions*? Get back to the API editor and follow the link. What do you see? Apicurio lets you follow the form-based editor or go one step beyond and direct edit the source of your API definition.

## Summary

In this exercise you used APIcurio Studio to import a simple API definition using the OpenAPI Specification (Swagger 2.0). You also learned how to author and download a standards compliant API Specification, using Red Hat's Apicurio Studio.
