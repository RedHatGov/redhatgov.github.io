      <description>Lab 1 API Design Create an OpenAPI Specification using Apicurio Studio  Duration: 10 mins Audience: API Owner, Product Manager, Developers, Architects  
Overview As APIs become more widespread in the enterprise, consistent design and usage is critically important to improve reusability. The more reusable APIs are, the less friction there is for other internal or external teams to make progress. Having design standards and tools baked into the API development and maintenance process is a very powerful way to enable this consistency.</description>
