      <description>Application streams Application streams deliver user space packages on a cadence that makes sense for the package rather than as a monolithic distribution. Streams also allow the consolidation of previous distribution channels to a single place.&#xA;Red Hat Insights Red Hat Insights is included with your Red Hat® Enterprise Linux® 8 subscription. It helps provide a security-focused, reliable, efficient, and scalable infrastructure environment.&#xA;Image builder Image builder lets customers build images from source RPMs that are deployable to multiple targets quickly and simply, and provides fine-grained control and visibility in to what’s included in a particular image and its history.</description>

      <description>Exercise Description To get started, we will take a tour of the web console. The web console (called cockpit) will be your primary interactive interface to RHEL. The console has a number of functions that enable you to manage most aspects of the installation.&#xA;Connect to your personal lab environment. Ensure that the information in the footer of the page is correctly filled out and the URL for your environment should show up below</description>

      <description>Section 1. Deploying Session Recording To be able to deploy the Session Recording solution you need to have the following packages installed: tlog, SSSD, cockpit-session-recording. Note that session recording doesn’t work for graphical desktop sessions or Cockpit terminal sessions.&#xA;Step 1.1: Pre-Requisites In order to work with session recording, your system will need to have the following installed:&#xA;tlog&#xA;SSSD (System Security Services Deamon)&#xA;cockpit-session-recording&#xA;For this workshop/lab the environment is already configured to have tlog and SSSD installed, but if you were to install these prerequisites yourself, you would run sudo yum install -y tlog cockpit-session-recording systemd-journal-remote</description>

      <description>Exercise Description RHEL 8 makes it easy to enforce a strong and consistent cryptographic policy on your systems.&#xA;In the following exercises we’ll use the new commands for managing your crypto configurations and test them. We will be using the web site badssl.com to test connections using different versions of relevant protocols, such as TLS.&#xA;Section 1: Viewing and changing the crypto policy Show the current crypto policy.&#xA;update-crypto-policies --show You should see something like …​</description>

      <description>Overview Application streams are new to RHEL 8 and provide access to the latest tools, languages and libraries, without affecting core system components. This capability gives users access to multiple versions of packages, with a known period of support. These application streams, usually provided as modules, can be thought of as package groups that represent an application, a set of tools, or runtime languages.&#xA;Section 1: Stream Availability Step 1: Check to see what PostgreSQL streams are available As root, use yum to see what streams are available, for PostgreSQL:</description>

      <description>Overview RHEL 8 makes it easy to maintain secure and compliant systems with OpenSCAP. What is SCAP? SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) is a NIST project that standardizes the language for describing assessment criteria and findings. It also provides a vulnerability rating system. The project’s home page is https://scap.nist.gov/&#xA;The essential components of SCAP are:&#xA;XCCDF: The Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format, to describe security checklists&#xA;OVAL®: Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language, a declarative language for making logical assertions about the state of a system</description>

      <description>Exercise Description In this exercise, you will build a custom application container utilizing the Red Hat Universal Base Image, customize that image and test the image functionality. After that you will use skopeo to transfer that image from your user local repository to the system repository and configure it to start at boot.&#xA;After completing this section, you will be able to build images from an existing base image using buildah and other host based tools.</description>

      <description>Exercise Description RHEL System Roles, announced with the launch of RHEL 8, are a collection of Ansible roles and modules that provide a stable and consistent configuration interface for remote management of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. They address many commmon configuration, security and workload uses on RHEL systems. These roles can manage systems running RHEL 7 and above, easing management of 3 generations of RHEL. The effort is based on development of the Linux System Roles project (link: https://linux-system-roles.</description>
