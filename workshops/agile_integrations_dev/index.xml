      <description>Lab 1 API Design Import an OpenAPI Specification using Apicurio Studio  Duration: 10 mins Audience: Developers, Architects  
Overview As APIs become more widespread in the enterprise, consistent design and usage is critically important to improve reusability. The more reusable APIs are, the less friction there is for other internal or external teams to make progress. Having design standards and tools baked into the API development and maintenance process is a very powerful way to enable this consistency.</description>

      <description>Lab 2 API Mocking Bring your APIs to life  Duration: 20 mins Audience: Developers, Architects, Testers, Quality Engineers  
Overview When building and working with APIs, you often need to simulate the responses of the system before it has been fully completed. This is what we explore in this workshop - mocking up API structures quickly so they can be subjected to testing without having to create all the final service code.</description>

      <description>Lab 3 Swagger to REST Contract-first API development with a database interface, implemented using Eclipse Che  Duration: 20 mins Audience: Developers and Architects  
Overview In the context of defining API&#39;s, it&#39;s common for a Business Analyst (or Citizen Integrator) to first create an API specification or contract. By beginning the process with a clearly defined contract, a Developer can easily take the contract and auto-generate the underlying service to implement that API.</description>

      <description>Lab 4 SOAP to REST (Optional) Contract-first API development wrapping an existing SOAP service, implemented using Eclipse Che  Duration: 20 mins Audience: Developers and Architects  
Overview Another important use case in developing API&#39;s is to take an existing legacy SOAP service and wrap it with a new RESTful endpoint. This SOAP to REST transformation is implemented in the API service layer (Fuse). This lab will walk you through taking an existing SOAP contract (WSDL), converting it to Java POJO&#39;s and exposing it using Camel REST DSL.</description>

      <description>Lab 6 Managed API Endpoints Take control of your APIs  Duration: 5 mins Audience: API Owners, Product Managers, Developers, Architects  
Overview Once you have APIs deployed in your environment, it becomes critically important to manage who may use them and for what purpose. You also need to begin to track usage of these different users to know who is/is not succeeding in their usage. For this reason in this lab you will be adding management capabilities to the API to give you control and visibility of it&#39;s usage.</description>

      <description>Lab 8 API Consumption Connect Applications and APIs  Duration: 15 mins Audience: API Consumers, Developers, Architects  
Overview APIs provide the building blocks for applications, but it is applications which deliver functionality to the end users. hence to see APIs in action it helps to see how applications can call APIs to provide new functionality. In this lab you&#39;ll be able to create a simple web application which consumes the API you built earlier in the exercises.</description>
