### 1 Fork the RedHatGov.io repo

Forking RedHatGov.io is a simple two-step process.

1. On GitHub, navigate to the https://github.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.github.io
repo.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.

That's it! Now, you have a [fork][git-fork] of the original RedHatGov/redhatgov.github.io
repo.

### 2 Create a local clone of your fork

Right now, you have a fork of the RedHatGov.io repo, but you don't have the files in that repo on your computer. Let's create a [clone][git-clone] of your fork locally on your computer.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-username/redhatgov.github.io.git
cd redhatgov.github.io

# Configure git to sync your fork with the original repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.github.io

# Never push to upstream repo
git remote set-url --push upstream no_push
```

### 3 Verify your [remotes][git-remotes]

To verify the new upstream repo you've specified for your fork, type
`git remote -v`. You should see the URL for your fork as `origin`, and the URL for the original repo as `upstream`.

```sh
origin  git@github.com:your-username/redhatgov.github.io.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:your-username/redhatgov.github.io.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.github.io (fetch)
upstream        no_push (push)
```

### 4 Modify your `docs`

Get your local `docs` [branch][git-branch], up to date:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout docs
git merge upstream/docs
```

Then build your local `docs` branch, make changes, etc.

### 5 Keep your `docs` in sync

```sh
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/docs
```

### 6 [Commit][git-commit] your `docs`

```sh
git commit
```

Likely you'll go back and edit, build, test, etc.

### 7 [Push][git-push] your `docs`

When ready to review (or just to establish an offsite backup of your work),
push your branch to your fork on `github.com`:

```sh
git push
```

### 8 Submit a [pull request][pr]

1. Visit your fork at https://github.com/your-username/redhatgov.github.io.git
2. Click the `Compare & Pull Request` button next to your `docs` branch.

At this point you're waiting on us. We may suggest some changes or improvements
or alternatives. We'll do our best to review and at least comment within 3
business days (often much sooner).

_If you have upstream write access_, please refrain from using the GitHub UI
for creating PRs, because GitHub will create the PR branch inside the main
repo rather than inside your fork.
